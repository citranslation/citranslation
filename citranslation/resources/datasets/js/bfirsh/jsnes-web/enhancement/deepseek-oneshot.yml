Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration for the Travis CI configuration you provided:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: ['master']
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  Unit:
    name: Unit Tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        node-version:
          - 22
          - 20
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test
```

Please note that the Travis CI configuration you provided is for Node.js, so the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration is also for Node.js. If your source Travis CI configuration is for a different language, you will need to adjust the configuration accordingly.
