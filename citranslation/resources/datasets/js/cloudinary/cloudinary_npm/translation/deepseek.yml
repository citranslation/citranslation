Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm run test-with-temp-cloud

notifications:
  email:
    recipients:
      - sdk_developers@cloudinary.com
```

Please note that the `dist: focal` in Travis CI is equivalent to `runs-on: ubuntu-latest` in GitHub Actions. The `matrix` feature in Travis CI is replaced by the `strategy.matrix` feature in GitHub Actions. The `script` in Travis CI is replaced by `run` in GitHub Actions. The `notifications` section is also kept as is.
