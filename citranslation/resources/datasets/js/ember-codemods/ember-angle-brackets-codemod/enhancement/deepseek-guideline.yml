This GitHub Action configuration is a direct translation of the Travis CI configuration you provided. It sets up a CI workflow that runs on every push and pull request. The workflow runs on the latest version of Ubuntu, and it uses the Node.js versions specified in the matrix. It checks out the code, sets up the Node.js environment, installs dependencies, runs the linting, testing, integration testing, and coverage reporting steps.
