Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Node.js CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      localstack:
        image: localstack/localstack:0.14.1
        ports:
          - 4566:4566
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Lint
        run: npm run lint
      - name: Test
        run: npm run test
      - name: Link dependencies
        run: npm link
      - name: Run integration tests
        run: |
          sleep 5
          SLS_DEBUG=1 npm run test:integration
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that in GitHub Actions, we don't need to specify the `node_js` section, as it's not a valid configuration option. Instead, we use the `runs-on` keyword to specify the environment (in this case, `ubuntu-latest`) and the `services` keyword to define the `localstack` service. The rest of the configuration is similar to the Travis CI configuration.
