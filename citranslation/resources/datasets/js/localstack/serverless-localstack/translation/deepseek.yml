Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Node CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    services:
      docker:
        image: localstack/localstack
        ports:
          - 4566

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js 12
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: 12
    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Lint
      run: npm run lint
    - name: Test
      run: npm run test
    - name: Setup Links for Integration Testing
      run: npm link
    - name: Kick off Integration Test
      run: |
        sleep 5
        SLS_DEBUG=1 npm run test:integration
```

Please note that the GitHub Actions configuration is slightly different from Travis CI. The main difference is that GitHub Actions does not have a built-in service runner, so we need to explicitly start the Docker service in the job. Also, GitHub Actions uses the `actions/checkout@v2` action to checkout the code, and `actions/setup-node@v1` to setup the Node.js environment.
