Here is the GitHub Action configuration equivalent to the provided Travis CI configuration:

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 30

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [12.x, 14.x, 16.x, 18.x, 20.x]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        cache: 'npm'
    - run: sudo apt install python3
    - run: sudo apt install php-cli
    - run: npm install
    - run: npm test

  check-tests-pass:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run test

|End-of-Code|
```

This GitHub Action configuration does the following:

1. It sets up a workflow that runs on every push and pull request.
2. It uses the latest version of Ubuntu as the environment to run the jobs.
3. It sets a timeout for the jobs to 30 minutes.
4. It uses a matrix strategy to run the jobs with different versions of Node.js.
5. It checks out the repository, sets up the Node.js version, installs Python and PHP, and runs the tests.
6. It also sets up a second job to check if the tests pass.
