Here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [0.8, 0.10, 0.12, 1.8, 2.5, 3.3, 4.9, 5.12, 6.17, 7.10, 8.17, 9.11, 10.24, 11.15, 12.22, 13.14, 14.16, 15.13]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm run build --if-present
    - run: npm test
    - run: npm run lint --if-present
    - run: npm run coverage --if-present
    - name: Coveralls
      if: matrix.node-version == '8.17'
      run: |
        npm install --save-dev coveralls
        nyc report --reporter=text-lcov | coveralls
      env:
        COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN }}
```

Please note that the GitHub Actions configuration is different from Travis CI configuration. The above configuration assumes that you have a `coveralls` package installed in your project and a `COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN` secret in your GitHub repository. The `nyc` package is used for code coverage, and it's installed in the `coveralls` step. The `nyc` command is run in the `Coveralls` step. The `if: matrix.node-version == '8.17'` condition is used to run the `nyc` and `coveralls` commands only for Node.js 8.17.

Also, the `npm ci` command is used instead of `npm install` to ensure that the `node_modules` directory is not recreated. The `npm run build` command is run if a `build` script is present in your `package.json` file. The `npm test`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run coverage` commands are run if these scripts are present in your `package.json` file.

The `COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN` secret should be set in your GitHub repository settings. It's used to authenticate with the Coveralls service.
