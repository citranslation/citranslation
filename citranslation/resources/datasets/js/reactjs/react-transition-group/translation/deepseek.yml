Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Node CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [14]
        react-version: [16, 17]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    - name: Cache node modules
      uses: actions/cache@v2
      with:
        path: '**/node_modules'
        key: ${{ runner.OS }}-modules-${{ hashFiles('**/yarn.lock') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.OS }}-modules-
    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: |
        yarn
        yarn add react@${{ matrix.react-version }} react-dom@${{ matrix.react-version }}
        yarn --cwd www
    - name: Run Tests
      run: yarn test
    - name: Build
      run: npm run build
    - name: Semantic Release
      run: npm run semantic-release

branches:
  only:
    - master
```

Please note that GitHub Actions do not support the `sudo: false` directive in the Travis CI configuration. This is because GitHub Actions run on a virtual environment provided by GitHub, and `sudo` is not supported in GitHub Actions.

Also, the `branches: only: - master` directive is equivalent to the `only: master` directive in GitHub Actions. This means that the workflow will only run on the master branch.
