Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn
      - name: Install React
        run: yarn add react@$REACT_DIST react-dom@$REACT_DIST
      - name: Run tests
        run: yarn test
      - name: Build and deploy
        run: |
          yarn build
          yarn semantic-release
      - name: Cache yarn
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: ~/.yarn-cache
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-yarn-cache
```
