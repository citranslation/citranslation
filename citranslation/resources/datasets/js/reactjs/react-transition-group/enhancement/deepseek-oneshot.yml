Here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: github-actions
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  check-tests-pass:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '12'
      - run: yarn
      - run: yarn add react@${{ matrix.react_dist }} react-dom@${{ matrix.react_dist }}
        env:
          REACT_DIST: ${{ matrix.react_dist }}
      - run: yarn --cwd www
      - run: yarn test
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm run semantic-release
branches:
  only:
    - master
```

Please note that GitHub Actions does not support the `env` keyword to set environment variables for each job in the matrix. However, you can use `matrix.react_dist` to access the value of `REACT_DIST` in the matrix.

Also, the `cache: yarn` in Travis CI is equivalent to `cache: 'yarn'` in GitHub Actions.
