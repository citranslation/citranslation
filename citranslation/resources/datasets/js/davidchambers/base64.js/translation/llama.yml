Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Node.js CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: ["12.22.0", "14", "16"]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: make setup
      - name: Lint and test
        run: make lint test
```
