Here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:
```
name: Node.js CI

on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: ["12", "14", "16"]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Generate coverage report
        run: npm run coveralls
      - name: Upload coverage report
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
          file: coverage.json
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that this configuration uses the `matrix` strategy to run the job for each version of Node.js specified in the `node` array. The `uses` keyword is used to specify the actions to run, and the `with` keyword is used to pass in the `node-version` parameter to the `setup-node` action. The `run` keyword is used to run the `npm install`, `npm test`, and `npm run coveralls` commands. The `codecov-action` is used to upload the coverage report to Codecov.
