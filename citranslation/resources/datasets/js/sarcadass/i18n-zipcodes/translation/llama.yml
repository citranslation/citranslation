Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Node.js CI

on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
      - name: Test
        run: npm test
      - name: Code coverage
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
          file: coverage.json
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that:

* The `on` section specifies that the workflow should run on push events.
* The `jobs` section defines a single job named `build`.
* The `runs-on` section specifies the environment where the job will run (in this case, an `ubuntu-latest` environment).
* The `steps` section defines the individual steps that will be executed in the job.
* The `Checkout code` step uses the `actions/checkout` action to check out the code.
* The `Install dependencies` step runs `npm install` to install dependencies.
* The `Build` and `Test` steps run the `npm run build` and `npm test` commands, respectively.
* The `Code coverage` step uses the `codecov/codecov-action` action to generate code coverage reports, and specifies the `token` and `file` options to configure the action.
