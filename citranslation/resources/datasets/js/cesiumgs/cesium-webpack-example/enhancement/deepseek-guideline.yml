This GitHub Action configuration is based on the Travis CI configuration you provided. It sets up a workflow that runs on every push and pull request. The workflow runs on the latest version of Ubuntu. It uses the `setup-node` action to set up Node.js versions 14.x and 16.x. It then runs `npm ci` and `npm run build` to install dependencies and build the project, respectively.
