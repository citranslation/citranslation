This GitHub Action configuration is a direct translation of the Travis CI configuration you provided. It sets up a workflow that runs on every push and pull request. The workflow runs on the latest version of Ubuntu, checks out the repository, sets up Node.js, installs dependencies, cleans and builds the project, and runs the test script.
