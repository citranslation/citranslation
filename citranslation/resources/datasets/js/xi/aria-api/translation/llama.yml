Here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:
```
name: Node.js CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Clean and build
        run: make clean && make
      - name: Cache node modules
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: ~/.nvm
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-modules-${{ hashFiles('**/package*.json') }}
      - name: Run tests
        run: npx mocha-headless-chrome -a no-sandbox -f test/index.html
      - name: Send notifications
        uses: github-actions/notify@v1
        with:
          title: Node.js CI
          message: "CI completed"
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that I've replaced the `sudo` directive with the `runs-on` keyword, which specifies the environment in which the job will run. I've also replaced the `install` section with separate steps for installing dependencies, cleaning and building, and caching node modules. The `script` section has been replaced with a `run` step that runs the `npx mocha-headless-chrome` command. Finally, I've added a `Send notifications` step to send a notification to the GitHub issue tracker.
