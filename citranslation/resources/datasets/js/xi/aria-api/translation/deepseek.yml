Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: node
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Clean and build
      run: |
        make clean
        make
    - name: Test with mocha-headless-chrome
      run: npx mocha-headless-chrome -a no-sandbox -f test/index.html

```

Please note that the `sudo: false` directive in Travis CI is not necessary in GitHub Actions as it is the default behavior. Also, the `cache:` directive is not necessary in GitHub Actions as it is automatically cached for the dependencies.
