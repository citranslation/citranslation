Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Node CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: node
    - name: npm install
      run: npm ci
    - name: npm run coverage
      run: npm run coverage
    - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1
      with:
        token: ${{secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN}}
        file: ./coverage/lcov.info
        disable: gcov
```

Please replace `${{secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN}}` with your actual Codecov token. You can set this in your GitHub repository settings under Secrets.

This GitHub Action configuration will trigger on every push and pull request to your repository. It will set up the Node.js environment, run `npm ci` to install the dependencies, run the `npm run coverage` command to generate the coverage report, and then upload the report to Codecov.
