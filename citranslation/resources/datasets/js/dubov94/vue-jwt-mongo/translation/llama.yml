Here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:
```
name: Node.js CI

on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run coverage
      - name: Generate coverage report
        run:./node_modules/.bin/codecov --disable=gcov --file=./coverage/lcov.info
      - name: Upload coverage report
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v2
        with:
          file:./coverage/lcov.info
          token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that you'll need to replace `CODECOV_TOKEN` with your actual Codecov token. Also, make sure to install the `codecov/codecov-action` action in your repository's `actions` directory.
