Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: ['0.12', '4']
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3.1.1
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
      - name: Install
        run: npm install
      - name: Test
        run: npm test
```

|End-of-Code|
