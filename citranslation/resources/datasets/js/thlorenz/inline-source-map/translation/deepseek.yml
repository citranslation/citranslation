Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [0.10, 0.12, io.js]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    - run: npm install --global npm
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm run build --if-present
    - run: npm test
```

Please note that the `sudo: false` directive in Travis CI is not applicable in GitHub Actions as it is used to run jobs in containers with no sudo access. The `language: node_js` directive is also not needed as GitHub Actions automatically sets up Node.js for you.

Also, the `npm ci` command is used instead of `npm install` to ensure that the `package-lock.json` or `npm-shrinkwrap.json` is used to install the dependencies, which is the recommended practice for Node.js projects.

The `npm run build` and `npm test` commands are run as an example, you may need to adjust these based on your project's needs.
