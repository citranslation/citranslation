# Notes on migration:
# - `language: node_js` is replaced by the `actions/setup-node` action.
# - `dist: focal` is mapped to `runs-on: ubuntu-20.04`.
# - `node_js` versions are mapped to `strategy.matrix.node-version`.
# - `arch: - amd64` is the default for `ubuntu-20.04` runners.
# - `services: - docker` is not needed as Docker is pre-installed and available on GitHub-hosted runners.
