Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [20.x, 18.x, 16.x, 14.x, 12.x]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        fetch-depth: 2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}

    - name: Install Python
      run: sudo apt-get install python3

    - name: Install PHP
      run: sudo apt-get install php-cli

    - name: Install bc (if s390x)
      if: ${{ matrix.os == 'ubuntu-latest' && matrix.arch == 's390x' }}
      run: sudo apt-get install bc

    - name: Install Docker
      run: |
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install docker-ce

    - name: npm install
      run: npm install

```

Please note that GitHub Actions do not support the `os` and `arch` fields in the same way as Travis CI. The `runs-on` field in the job specifies the type of runner that the job will run on, and the `matrix` strategy allows you to specify different versions of Node.js to test on.

Also, the `before_install` section in Travis CI is split into separate steps in GitHub Actions. The `if` condition in Travis CI is replaced with the `if` condition in GitHub Actions.

The `install` section in Travis CI is replaced with a step that runs `npm install`.

The `git` depth is set in the checkout step.

The `services` section in Travis CI is not used in GitHub Actions as it is used to start and stop services before and after the job runs.
