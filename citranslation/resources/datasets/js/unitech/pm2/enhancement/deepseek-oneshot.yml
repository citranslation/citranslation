Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Serverless LocalStack CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  serverless-localstack-test:
    name: Serverless LocalStack CI
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup NodeJS
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '12'

      - name: Start LocalStack
        run: |
          pip install localstack awscli-local[ver1]
          docker pull localstack/localstack
          localstack start -d
          localstack wait -t 30
          
      - name: Install deps
        run: |
          npm ci
          
      - name: Run Lint and Test
        run: |
          set -e
          npm run lint
          npm run test
          
      - name: Integration Tests
        run: |
          npm link
          sleep 5; SLS_DEBUG=1 npm run test:integration
```
