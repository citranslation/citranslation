Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [16.x]
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm run build --if-present
    - run: npm test
```

Please note that GitHub Actions does not support the `arch` and `sudo: false` options in the Travis CI configuration. The `arch` option is used to specify the architecture of the runner, but GitHub Actions automatically runs on different types of runners with different architectures. The `sudo: false` option is used to run the job in a container, which is the default behavior in GitHub Actions.
