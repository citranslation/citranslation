This GitHub Action configuration is a direct translation of the Travis CI configuration provided. It sets up a CI workflow that runs on push and pull request events. The workflow runs on different operating systems (Ubuntu, MacOS, and Windows) and architectures (x64 and arm64). It checks out the code, sets up Node.js, installs dependencies, builds the project, and runs tests.
