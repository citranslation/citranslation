Here is the GitHub Action configuration equivalent to the provided Travis CI configuration:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    name: Test on Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: ["node", "lts/*", "20", "19", "18", "17", "16", "15", "14", "13", "12", "11", "10", "8"]
      fail-fast: false

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}

      - name: Run Tests
        run: node test/test

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [16]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build

|End-of-Code|
```

This GitHub Action configuration does the following:

1. It sets up a workflow that triggers on `push` and `pull_request` events on the `main` branch.
2. It has two jobs: `test` and `build`.
3. The `test` job runs on the latest Ubuntu, uses a matrix strategy to test on different Node.js versions, and uses the `actions/checkout@v4` and `actions/setup-node@v4` actions to checkout the code and set up the Node.js environment, respectively.
4. The `build` job also runs on the latest Ubuntu, uses a matrix strategy to build on Node.js version 16, and uses the `actions/checkout@v2` and `actions/setup-node@v2` actions to checkout the code and set up the Node.js environment, respectively.
5. Both jobs run the `npm ci` command to install the dependencies and the `npm run build` command to build the source code.
