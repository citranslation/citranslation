Here is the GitHub Action configuration equivalent to the provided Travis CI configuration:

```yaml
name: Build

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    name: Lint and tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        node-version:
          - 8
          - 10
          - 12
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm run test-ci

|End-of-Code|
```

Please note that the GitHub Actions configuration is not fully equivalent to the Travis CI configuration. The Travis CI configuration includes a `sudo: false` directive which is not necessary in GitHub Actions as it runs on a virtual environment provided by GitHub. The Travis CI configuration also includes a `notifications: email: false` directive which is not necessary as GitHub Actions do not support email notifications. The Travis CI configuration also includes a `notifications: email: kempdogg@gmail.com` directive which is not necessary as GitHub Actions do not support email notifications. The Travis CI configuration includes a `cache: npm` directive which is not necessary in GitHub Actions as GitHub Actions automatically caches the node modules. The Travis CI configuration includes a `branches: only: - master` directive which is not necessary in GitHub Actions as GitHub Actions runs on all branches by default.
