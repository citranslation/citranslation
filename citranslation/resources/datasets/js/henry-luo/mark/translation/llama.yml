Here is the migrated GitHub Action configuration:
```
name: Node.js CI

on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Install codecov
        run: npm install -g codecov
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install boolbase nth-check htmlparser2
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run coverage
      - name: Generate coverage report
        run: codecov
      - name: Upload coverage report
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
          file: coverage.json
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that I've replaced the `node_js` section with the `runs-on` keyword, which specifies the environment where the job will run. I've also replaced the `install` section with separate `run` steps for installing dependencies and installing codecov. The `script` section has been replaced with separate `run` steps for running tests and generating the coverage report. Finally, I've added a new step to upload the coverage report using the codecov-action.
