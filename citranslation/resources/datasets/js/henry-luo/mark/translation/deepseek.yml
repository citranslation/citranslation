Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: stable
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        npm install -g codecov
        npm install boolbase nth-check htmlparser2
        npm install tape tap-spec istanbul
    - name: Run tests and coverage
      run: |
        npm run coverage
        codecov
```

This configuration will trigger the workflow on every push and pull request to the repository. It will use the latest version of Ubuntu to run the tests, set up Node.js, install the necessary dependencies, and run the tests and coverage.
