Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Node.js CI

on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: ["12", "10"]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Generate coverage report
        run: nyc report --reporter=text-lcov
      - name: Upload coverage report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        with:
          name: coverage
          path: coverage/lcov.info
      - name: Deploy to Coveralls
        uses: coveralls/action@v2
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          file: coverage/lcov.info
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that this configuration uses the `ubuntu-latest` environment, which is a more modern and secure alternative to the `node` environment used in Travis CI. The `matrix` strategy is used to run the tests on multiple Node.js versions. The `actions/upload-artifact` step is used to upload the coverage report as an artifact, which can be downloaded and used by the `coveralls` action.
