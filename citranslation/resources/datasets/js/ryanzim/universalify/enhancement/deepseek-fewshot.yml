Here is the GitHub Action configuration equivalent to the Travis CI configuration you provided:

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [12.x, 14.x, 16.x, 18.x, 20.x, 22.x]
        # See supported Node.js release schedule at https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        cache: "npm"
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm test
    - name: Coveralls
      uses: coverallsapp/github-action@1.1.3
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
|End-of-Code|
```

This configuration will run the tests and coverage for each Node.js version specified in the matrix, and it will also report the coverage to Coveralls. The `secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN` is used to authenticate with Coveralls.
