Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: 16
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
    - name: Run coverage
      run: npm run coverage
|End-of-Code|
```

This configuration will trigger the workflow on every push and pull request to the repository. It will run on the latest version of Ubuntu, set up Node.js 16, install the dependencies, run the tests, and run the coverage.
