Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Node.js CI

on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Install coveralls
        run: npm install -g coveralls
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Generate coverage report
        run: npm run coverage
      - name: Upload coverage report
        uses: coveralls/action@v2
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          report-file: coverage/lcov.info
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that in GitHub Actions, we use the `on` keyword to specify the event that triggers the workflow (in this case, a push event). We also use the `jobs` keyword to define a job named `build`, which runs on an `ubuntu-latest` environment.

The `steps` keyword is used to define the individual steps in the job. Each step is a separate command that is executed in sequence. In this case, we have five steps:

1. Checkout the code using the `actions/checkout` action.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Install coveralls globally using `npm install -g coveralls`.
4. Run the tests using `npm test`.
5. Generate a coverage report using `npm run coverage`.
6. Upload the coverage report to Coveralls using the `coveralls/action` action.

We also use the `with` keyword to pass in some configuration options to the `coveralls/action` step, such as the GitHub token and the report file.
