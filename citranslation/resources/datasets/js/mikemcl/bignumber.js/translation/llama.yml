Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os:
          - ppc64le
          - amd64
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: |
            node
            lts/*
            20
            19
            18
            17
            16
            15
            14
            13
            12
            11
            10
            8
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: production
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that in GitHub Actions, we use the `runs-on` keyword to specify the matrix of environments to run the job on, and the `strategy` keyword to define the matrix. We also use the `uses` keyword to specify the actions to run, and the `with` keyword to pass in the node version as a multi-line string.
