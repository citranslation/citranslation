Here is the GitHub Action configuration equivalent to the provided Travis CI configuration:

```yaml
name: "Run Automated Tests"

on:
  push:
    branches: [master]
  pull_request:
    branches: [master]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 30
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [10.x, 12.x, 14.x]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code 🛎️
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - name: Install dependencies and run tests
        run: |
          npm ci
          npm test

name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [16]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:

      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        node-version:
          - 8
          - 10
          - 12
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm run test-ci
```

Please note that the Travis CI configuration you provided is missing some parts such as the `before_install` section which is used to install grunt-cli globally. In the GitHub Action configuration, it is not necessary to install grunt-cli globally because GitHub Actions uses a fresh, fresh virtual environment for each job. You can install it in the `npm ci` step.
