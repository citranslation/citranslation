Here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration for the Travis CI configuration you provided:

```yaml
name: Node CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [10.x, 11.x, 12.x]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm run build --if-present
    - run: npm test
```

This configuration will trigger the workflow on every push and pull request to the repository. It will run on the latest version of Ubuntu, and for each version of Node.js specified in the matrix, it will checkout the code, set up the Node.js version, and run `npm ci`, `npm run build`, and `npm test`.

Please note that the GitHub Actions configuration might not be exactly the same as the Travis CI configuration due to the differences in the platforms and features supported by Travis CI and GitHub Actions. The above configuration is a general translation based on the information provided.
