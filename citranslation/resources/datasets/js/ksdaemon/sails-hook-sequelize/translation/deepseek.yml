Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:9.6
        env:
          POSTGRES_DB: sequelize
        ports:
          - 5432:5432
        options: --health-cmd pg_isready --health-interval 10s --health-timeout 5s --health-retries 5

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: node
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm run build --if-present
    - run: npm test
    - run: npx istanbul cover ./node_modules/mocha/bin/_mocha --report lcovonly test/overall.test.js -- --exit
    - run: cat ./coverage/lcov.info | npx coveralls
    - run: rm -rf ./coverage
    - name: Notify
      uses: dawidd6/action-send-mail@v2
      with:
        server_address: smtp.gmail.com
        server_port: 465
        username: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_PASSWORD }}
        subject: Build status
        body: |
          Build status: ${{ job.status }}
        to: KSDaemon@ya.ru
        from: KSDaemon@ya.ru
        smtp_debug: true
        content_type: text/plain
      if: ${{ always() }}
```

Please replace `EMAIL_USERNAME` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` with your actual Gmail username and password. These are stored as secrets in your GitHub repository settings.

This GitHub Action configuration does the following:

1. It runs on every push and pull request.
2. It uses the latest version of Ubuntu.
3. It sets up Node.js.
4. It installs dependencies and builds the project.
5. It runs tests.
6. It generates coverage report and sends it to coveralls.
7. It removes the coverage directory.
8. It sends an email notification with the build status.

Please note that the email notification part is using a third-party action, `dawidd6/action-send-mail@v2`, which requires SMTP credentials. You should replace `EMAIL_USERNAME` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` with your actual Gmail username and password. These are stored as secrets in your GitHub repository settings.
