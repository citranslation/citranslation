```yaml
# This GitHub Actions workflow was migrated from the provided Travis CI configuration.
# Key changes and considerations:
# 1. Environment: The 'language' and 'node_js' keys are replaced by the 'actions/setup-node' action.
# 2. Services: The 'addons: postgresql' section is replaced by a 'services' block, which starts a PostgreSQL 9.6 container.
# 3. Database Setup: The 'before_install' command 'psql -c create database...' is handled more cleanly by setting the 'POSTGRES_DB' environment variable in the service definition, which automatically creates the database.
# 4. Scripts: 'script' and 'after_script' are mapped to 'steps' in the job. Environment variables for the database connection are set for the test step.
# 5. Coverage: The complex 'after_script' for Coveralls is replaced by the modern 'coverallsapp/github-action'. The 'if: always()' condition is used on the coverage steps to mimic the behavior of 'after_script', which runs regardless of the main script's success or failure.
# 6. Notifications: The 'notifications' block is not migrated as GitHub Actions has its own built-in notification system based on repository watch settings and workflow status.
