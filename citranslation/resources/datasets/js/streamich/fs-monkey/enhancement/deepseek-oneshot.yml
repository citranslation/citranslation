Here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Travis CI to GitHub Actions

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16

      - name: Install
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      - name: Run static server in the background
        run: npm run serve &

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Release?
        run: npm run semantic-release
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

Please note that Travis CI and GitHub Actions are quite different in terms of functionality and capabilities. The Travis CI configuration you provided is for continuous integration and deployment, while the GitHub Actions configuration provided is for running a series of steps in a workflow. You may need to adjust the GitHub Actions configuration to match your specific needs.

Also, please ensure that you have set up the `GITHUB_TOKEN` and `NPM_TOKEN` secrets in your GitHub repository settings for the `semantic-release` to work properly.
