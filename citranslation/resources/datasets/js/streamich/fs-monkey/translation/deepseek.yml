Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Node CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [16.x]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    - name: Cache node modules
      uses: actions/cache@v2
      with:
        path: ~/.npm
        key: ${{ runner.OS }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.OS }}-node-
    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Run Tests
      run: npm run test
    - name: Build
      run: npm run build
    - name: Semantic Release
      run: npx semantic-release

  # Add a job to deploy on tags
  deploy:
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: npm ci
    - name: Deploy
      run: npm run deploy

branches:
  except:
    - /^v\d+\.\d+\.\d+$/
```

This GitHub Action configuration does the following:

1. It sets up a workflow that triggers on push and pull request events.
2. It runs the build job on the latest Ubuntu runner.
3. It sets up the Node.js environment with the specified version.
4. It caches the node modules for faster builds.
5. It installs the dependencies using `npm ci`.
6. It runs the tests and builds the project.
7. It uses `npx semantic-release` for semantic versioning and release management.
8. It adds a separate job to deploy the project on tags.
9. It ignores branches matching the provided regex.

Please note that the `deploy` job assumes that there is a `deploy` script in your `package.json` file. If you don't have this script, you should replace the `npm run deploy` command with the appropriate deployment command for your project.
