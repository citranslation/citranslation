Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Build and Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  schedule:
    - cron: 0 0 * * * *

jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: 'lts/*'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Build data
        run: npm run build.data
      - name: Build site
        run: npm run build.site
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        uses: gh-pages-deploy@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          keep-history: true
          skip-cleanup: true
          target-branch: master
          verbose: true
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that in GitHub Actions, we use the `on` section to specify the trigger (push and cron schedule) and the `jobs` section to define the job that will run. The `steps` section defines the individual tasks that will be executed in the job. We use the `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-node` actions to checkout the code and set up Node.js, respectively. The `run` keyword is used to execute shell commands, and the `gh-pages-deploy` action is used to deploy the site to GitHub Pages.
