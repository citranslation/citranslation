Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: 'lts/*'
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm run build.data
    - run: npm run build.site

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@3.7.1
      with:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        BRANCH: master
        FOLDER: .
        CLEAN: true
        HISTORY: true
        VERBOSE: true
```

Please note that the GitHub Action configuration is slightly different from Travis CI configuration. The GitHub Action configuration above assumes that you have a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository where you place this YAML file. Also, the `npm ci` command is used instead of `npm install` to ensure that the `node_modules` directory is not included in the repository.

Also, the `JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@3.7.1` is used for deploying to GitHub Pages. This action is a fork of the original `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v2.6.1`, which has been updated to support the new GitHub Actions environment.

The `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret is automatically provided by GitHub Actions and does not need to be set manually.
