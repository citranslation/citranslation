Here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [0.12.x, 4.x, 5.x]

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        cache: 'npm'

    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run Tests
      run: npm test

|End-of-Code|
```

Please note that the Travis CI configuration you provided does not include a `before_install` step, which is used to install a specific version of npm (`npm@2.14.5`). GitHub Actions does not have a direct equivalent to this step. However, the `npm install` command is run in the "Install Dependencies" step.

Also, the Travis CI configuration does not include a `notifications` section for email notifications. GitHub Actions does not support email notifications.

Finally, the Travis CI configuration does not include a `script` step for running the `npm run build.data` and `npm run build.site` commands. These commands are not included in the GitHub Action configuration.
