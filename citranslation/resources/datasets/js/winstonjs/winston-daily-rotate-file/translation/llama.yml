Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: ["16", "17"]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install $WINSTON_VER
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```
