# Note on notifications:
# GitHub Actions handles notifications differently than Travis CI.
# Email notifications are configured in your GitHub account settings
# (github.com/settings/notifications) for repositories you are watching.
# There is no direct equivalent to the `notifications.email` block in the workflow file.
