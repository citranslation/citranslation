Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Node.js 16

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install Node.js 16
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test
```
