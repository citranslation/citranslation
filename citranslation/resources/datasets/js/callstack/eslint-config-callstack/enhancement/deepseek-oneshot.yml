Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: github-actions
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  check-tests-pass:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '14'
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm run test
```

|End-of-Code|
