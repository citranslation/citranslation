Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Setup Node.js environment
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '18'

    - name: Install Yarn
      run: |
        curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash -s -- --version 1.17.3
        echo "::add-path::$HOME/.yarn/bin"

    - name: Cache node modules
      uses: actions/cache@v2
      with:
        path: '**/node_modules'
        key: ${{ runner.OS }}-modules-${{ hashFiles('**/yarn.lock') }}

    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: yarn install

    - name: Run Tests
      run: yarn test

|End-of-Code|
```

This GitHub Actions configuration does the following:

1. It triggers on push and pull request events.
2. It sets up the Node.js environment with the specified version.
3. It installs Yarn with the specified version.
4. It caches the node modules to speed up subsequent builds.
5. It installs the dependencies using Yarn.
6. It runs the tests using Yarn.

Please note that the `notifications` section in the Travis CI configuration is not directly translated to GitHub Actions as GitHub Actions does not support email notifications.
