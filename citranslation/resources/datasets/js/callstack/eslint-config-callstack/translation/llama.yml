Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Install Yarn
        run: |
          curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash -s -- --version 1.17.3
          export PATH=$HOME/.yarn/bin:$PATH
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn install
      - name: Cache yarn cache
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: ~/.yarn/cache
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-yarn-cache
      - name: Run tests
        run: yarn test
      - name: Cache node_modules
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: node_modules
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-modules
      - name: Cache test/node_modules
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: test/node_modules
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-test-node-modules
    environment:
      NODE_VERSION: "18"
    services:
      node: "18"
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that in GitHub Actions, we use the `runs-on` keyword to specify the environment where the job will run, which is an `ubuntu-latest` environment in this case. We also use the `uses` keyword to specify the actions that will be executed, such as `actions/checkout@v2` to checkout the code and `actions/cache@v2` to cache the dependencies. The `with` keyword is used to specify the configuration options for each action.
