Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Node.js Build and Test

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: ["12", "14", "16"]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Build and test
        run: npm run build
      - name: Run playwright
        run: npx playwright install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test
    environment:
      BROWSER: firefox
