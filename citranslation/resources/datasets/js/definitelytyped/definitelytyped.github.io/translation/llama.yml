Here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:
```
name: Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - source

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Deploy
        run: npm run deploy
      - name: Login to GitHub
        uses: docker/login-action@v1
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - name: Deploy to GitHub
        uses: docker/deploy-action@v1
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_USERNAME }}
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          repo: ${{ github.repository }}
          ref: ${{ github.event.ref }}
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that in GitHub Actions, we need to specify the `runs-on` keyword to indicate the environment where the job will run. In this case, we're using an `ubuntu-latest` environment. We also need to specify the `steps` keyword to define the sequence of actions to perform.

The `Checkout code` step uses the `actions/checkout` action to check out the code in the repository. The `Install dependencies` step runs the `npm install` command to install the dependencies specified in the `package.json` file.

The `Deploy` step runs the `npm run deploy` command to deploy the application.

The `Login to GitHub` and `Deploy to GitHub` steps use the `docker/login-action` and `docker/deploy-action` actions, respectively, to login to GitHub and deploy the application to the repository. These actions require the `GITHUB_USERNAME` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` secrets to be set in the repository settings.

Finally, the `ref` parameter in the `Deploy to GitHub` step is set to the `github.event.ref` variable, which represents the ref (branch or tag) that triggered the workflow.
