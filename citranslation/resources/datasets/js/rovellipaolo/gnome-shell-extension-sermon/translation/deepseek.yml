Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [12.x, 14.x, 15.x]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        make install-checkstyle
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install -qy gjs libgjs-dev
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        make checkstyle
        make test
```

Please note that the `node-version` in the matrix is set to the latest stable versions of Node.js. You may need to adjust this according to your project's requirements.

Also, please ensure that the `make` commands are valid in your project and they are correctly installed in the environment where the GitHub Action is running.
