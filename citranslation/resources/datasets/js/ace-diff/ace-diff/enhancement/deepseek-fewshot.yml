Here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Checks

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
      - main
      - next
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master
      - main
      - next

jobs:
  test-node:
    name: Test on Node.js v${{ matrix.node-version }}
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        node-version: [16.x]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          cache: npm
      - name: install
        run: npm ci
      - name: run tests
        run: npm run test
        env:
          CI: true

  release:
    if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' && (github.event.ref == 'refs/heads/main' || github.event.ref == 'refs/heads/next' || github.event.ref == 'refs/heads/master') }}
    name: Release new version
    needs: [test-node]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16.x
          cache: npm
      - name: install
        run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npx semantic-release
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          NPM_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@master
        with:
          ref: master

      - name: Setup node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Test
        run: npm test

      - name: Compute coverage
        run: npm run coverage

      - name: Publish coverage
        uses: coverallsapp/github-action@v2

|End-of-Code|
```

This GitHub Action configuration is equivalent to the Travis CI configuration provided. It includes three jobs: `test-node`, `release`, and `test`. The `test-node` job runs tests on Node.js 16.x. The `release` job is triggered when a push event occurs on the `master`, `main`, or `next` branches and it builds and releases a new version. The `test` job runs tests, computes coverage, and publishes the coverage to Coveralls.
