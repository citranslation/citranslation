Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
      - name: Serve
        run: npm run serve &
      - name: Test
        run: npm test
      - name: Release
        run: npm run semantic-release
```
