Here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Node CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-16.04

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [12.x]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm run build
    - run: npm run serve &
    - run: npm test

  release:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-16.04
    steps:
    - name: Release
      run: npm run semantic-release
|End-of-Code|
```

This GitHub Action configuration does the following:

1. It triggers on push and pull request events.
2. It runs the build job on Ubuntu 16.04 with Node.js 12.x.
3. It checks out the code, sets up Node.js, installs dependencies, builds the code, runs the server in the background, and runs tests.
4. It runs the release job after the build job has completed successfully. This job runs the `semantic-release` script.
5. The `|End-of-Code|` marker indicates the end of the configuration.
