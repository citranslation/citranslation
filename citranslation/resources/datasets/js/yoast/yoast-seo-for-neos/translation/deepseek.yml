Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Travis CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Setup Node.js environment
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: 14

    - name: Cache
      uses: actions/cache@v2
      with:
        path: '**/node_modules'
        key: ${{ runner.OS }}-modules-${{ hashFiles('**/yarn.lock') }}

    - name: Install
      run: yarn install

    - name: Build Inspector View
      run: yarn build:inspectorView

    - name: Build Edit Mode
      run: yarn build:editMode
```

Please note that the GitHub Actions configuration is different from Travis CI. The above configuration assumes that you are using Node.js version 14, and it caches the node_modules directory. You may need to adjust the configuration based on your specific needs.
