Here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration for the provided Travis CI configuration:

```yaml
name: Node CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm run build --if-present
    - run: npm test

|End-of-Code|
```

This GitHub Action configuration does the following:

- It sets up a workflow that runs on every push and pull request.
- It uses the `ubuntu-latest` runner.
- It sets up a matrix strategy with Node.js versions 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
- It checks out the repository.
- It sets up the Node.js environment for each matrix combination.
- It runs `npm ci` to install the project dependencies.
- It runs `npm run build` if it exists.
- It runs `npm test` to run the tests.
