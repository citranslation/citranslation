Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [linux, osx]
        node: ["node"]

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Install codecov
        run: npm install -g codecov

      - name: Build and test
        run: npm run build
        run: npm run test

      - name: Code coverage
        run: codecov

      - name: Build and package (only for Linux)
        if: matrix.os == 'linux'
        run: npm run dist

      - name: Build and package (only for macOS)
        if: matrix.os == 'osx'
        run: npm run dist -- --mac --win
```
