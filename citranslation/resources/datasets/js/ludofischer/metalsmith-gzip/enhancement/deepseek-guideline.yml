This GitHub Action configuration is a direct translation of the Travis CI configuration you provided. It sets up a workflow that runs on every push and pull request. The workflow runs on the latest version of Ubuntu, and it uses the `setup-node` action to set up different versions of Node.js. The workflow then runs `npm ci` to install the project dependencies, `npm run build` to build the project, and `npm test` to run the tests.
