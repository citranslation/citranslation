Here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration for the provided Travis CI configuration:

```yaml
name: Build & Test

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [12.x, 14.x, 16.x]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
    - name: dependencies
      run: npm install
    - run: mkdir -p dist
    - name: build
      run: npx browserify index.js -o dist/aria.js -s aria
    - name: test
      run: npx mocha-headless-chrome -a no-sandbox -f test/index.html

  CI:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: ["16.x", "18.x", "20.x"]
    steps:
        - name: Checkout
          uses: actions/checkout@v4
        - name: Setup node
          uses: actions/setup-node@v3
          with:
            node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        - run: npm ci
        - run: npm run validate
|End-of-Code|
```

Please note that the `node_js` version in the Travis CI configuration is not directly translated to GitHub Actions because GitHub Actions does not have a direct equivalent to Travis CI's `node_js`. Instead, we use the `actions/setup-node@v3` action to install a specific version of Node.js. The version is specified in the `with.node-version` input.

Also, the `sudo: false` directive in Travis CI is not necessary in GitHub Actions because it is the default behavior. GitHub Actions runners are automatically isolated from the host system.

The `cache` directive in Travis CI is also not directly translated because GitHub Actions does not have a direct equivalent. However, you can use the `actions/cache@v2` action to cache dependencies and build outputs.

The `notifications` directive in Travis CI is not directly translated because GitHub Actions does not have a direct equivalent. However, you can use the `actions/slack@v2` action to send notifications to a Slack channel.

The `after_success` directive in Travis CI is not directly translated because GitHub Actions does not have a direct equivalent. However, you can use the `run` step in a job to run a command after the job succeeds.

The `branches` directive in Travis CI is not directly translated because GitHub Actions does not have a direct equivalent. However, you can use the `branches-ignore` input in the `actions/checkout@v3` action to ignore certain branches.

The `script` directive in Travis CI is not directly translated because GitHub Actions does not have a direct equivalent. However, you can use the `run` step in a job to run a command.

The `language` directive in Travis CI is not directly translated because GitHub Actions does not have a direct equivalent. However, you can use the `runs-on` input in a job to specify the type of runner.

The `install` and `script` directives in Travis CI are not directly translated because GitHub Actions does not have a direct equivalent. However, you can use the `run` step in a job to run a command.
