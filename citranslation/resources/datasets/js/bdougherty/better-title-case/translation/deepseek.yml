Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Node.js CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Use Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: '14' # You can specify the version here

    - name: Cache node modules
      uses: actions/cache@v2
      with:
        path: node_modules
        key: ${{ runner.OS }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.OS }}-node-

    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: npm ci

    - name: Build
      run: npm run build --if-present

    - name: Test
      run: npm test
```

This GitHub Action configuration does the following:

1. It triggers on push and pull request events.
2. It sets up the latest version of Ubuntu as the environment to run the job.
3. It checks out your repository using the `actions/checkout@v2` action.
4. It sets up Node.js using the `actions/setup-node@v1` action.
5. It caches the `node_modules` directory to speed up subsequent builds by storing and retrieving the cache.
6. It installs the dependencies using `npm ci`.
7. It builds the project using `npm run build --if-present`.
8. It runs tests using `npm test`.

Please note that the version of Node.js used in the GitHub Action configuration is '14'. You may need to adjust this to match the version you are using in Travis CI.
