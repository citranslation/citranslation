    strategy:
      # This creates a build matrix to run the job against multiple Node.js versions,
      # mirroring the Travis CI configuration.
      matrix:
        # "lts/*" and "node" from Travis CI are mapped here.
        # 'latest' can be used as an alias for the latest supported Node.js version.

    steps:
      # 1. Checks out the repository code.
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Sets up the specified Node.js version from the matrix.
      # This step also handles caching of npm dependencies, replacing the `cache` directive from Travis CI.

      # 5. (Optional) Add a build step if your project has one.
