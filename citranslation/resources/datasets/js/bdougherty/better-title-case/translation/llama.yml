Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Node.js CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: ["node", "lts/*"]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
        working-directory:.
      - name: Cache node modules
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: node_modules
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package*.json') }}
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
        working-directory:.
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that in GitHub Actions, we use the `runs-on` keyword to specify the environment (in this case, an `ubuntu-latest` environment), and the `strategy` keyword to specify the matrix of nodes to run. We also use the `uses` keyword to specify the actions to run, and the `with` keyword to pass parameters to those actions.
