Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
      - name: Lint
        run: npm run lint
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test:ci
      - name: Send notification
        uses: actions/send-email@v1
        if: failure()
        with:
          to: 'your-email@example.com'
          subject: 'CI Build Failed'
          body: 'CI build failed on branch ${GITHUB_BRANCH}'
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that in GitHub Actions, we use the `on` keyword to specify the event that triggers the workflow, which in this case is a push event on the `main` branch. We also use the `runs-on` keyword to specify the environment where the workflow will run, which is an `ubuntu-latest` environment.

The `steps` keyword is used to define the individual steps in the workflow. Each step is a separate command that is executed in sequence. In this case, we have five steps:

1. Checkout the code using the `actions/checkout` action.
2. Install dependencies using `npm ci`.
3. Run the build command using `npm run build`.
4. Run the lint command using `npm run lint`.
5. Run the tests using `npm run test:ci`.

The `if` keyword is used to specify the condition under which the `Send notification` step will be executed. In this case, the step will only be executed if the build fails.

The `uses` keyword is used to specify the action that will be used to send the email notification. The `with` keyword is used to specify the email settings, including the recipient, subject, and body.
