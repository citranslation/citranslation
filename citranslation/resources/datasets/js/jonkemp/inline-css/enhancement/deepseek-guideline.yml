Please note that the GitHub Actions configuration above assumes that you have a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository. The `actions/checkout@v2` step is used to checkout your repository, `actions/setup-node@v2` is used to setup the specified Node.js version, and `npm ci` is used to install the project dependencies. The `npm run lint`, `npm run coveralls`, and `npm run bootstrap` steps are used to run the linting, coverage, and bootstrapping scripts respectively.
