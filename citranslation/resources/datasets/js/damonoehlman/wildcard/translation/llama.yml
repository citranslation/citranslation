Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Node.js CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: ["10", "11", "12"]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Send notification
        uses: env-var/notify-email@v1
        with:
          email: damon.oehlman@gmail.com
          subject: Node.js CI build result
          body: 'The build has completed'
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that in GitHub Actions, we use a `matrix` strategy to run the job for multiple Node.js versions, whereas in Travis CI, we used a list of nodes. We also use the `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-node` actions to checkout the code and set up the Node.js environment, respectively. The `run` step is used to run the tests, and the `env-var/notify-email` action is used to send an email notification.
