Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Node.js CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Install codecov
        run: npm install -g codecov
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test-ci
      - name: Upload coverage report
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
          file: coverage.json

      - name: Use Node.js 8
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: 8

      - name: Use Node.js 10
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: 10

      - name: Use Node.js 12
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: 12
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that in GitHub Actions, we use the `on` keyword to specify the event that triggers the workflow, which in this case is a push event. We also use the `jobs` keyword to define a job named `build`, which runs on an `ubuntu-latest` environment.

The `steps` keyword is used to define the individual steps in the job. We use the `uses` keyword to reuse actions from the GitHub Actions marketplace, such as `actions/checkout@v2` to checkout the code, and `codecov/codecov-action@v1` to upload the coverage report.

We also use the `run` keyword to run shell commands, such as `npm install` and `npm run test-ci`. We use the `with` keyword to pass environment variables to the actions, such as the `node-version` for the `setup-node` action.

Finally, we use the `name` keyword to give a name to each step, which is displayed in the GitHub Actions UI.
