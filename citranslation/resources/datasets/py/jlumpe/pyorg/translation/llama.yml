Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: python -m pytest -v
```
