Here is the GitHub Action configuration equivalent to the provided Travis CI configuration:

```yaml
name: Test

on: [push, pull_request, workflow_dispatch]

env:
  FORCE_COLOR: 1

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10"]
        os: [ubuntu-latest]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
          cache: pip
          cache-dependency-path: docs/requirements.txt

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install -U pip
          python -m pip install -U wheel
          python -m pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
          python -m pip install -U pytest
          python -m pip install -e .

      - name: Test
        run: |
          pytest

|End-of-Code|
```

This configuration is equivalent to the Travis CI configuration provided in the first example. It sets up a workflow that runs on push, pull request, and manual workflow dispatch events. The workflow runs on the latest Ubuntu environment and tests the Python versions 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10. The workflow checks out the code, sets up Python, installs the dependencies, and runs the tests.
