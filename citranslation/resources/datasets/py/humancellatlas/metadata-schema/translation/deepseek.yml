Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  schema-linter:
    name: Schema linter
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python 3.6
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.6
    - name: Run schema linter
      run: |
        cd src
        python schema_linter.py --environment ${{ github.ref }}

  schema-tests:
    name: Schema tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Node.js 8
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: 8
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        cd tests
        npm install
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        npm test

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

notifications:
  slack:
    secrets:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    on_failure: change
    on_success: change
```

Please replace `${{ github.ref }}` with `${{ github.ref_name }}` if you want to use the branch name instead of the full ref.

This configuration will trigger the workflow on every push and pull request. The "schema-linter" job will use Python 3.6 to run the schema linter, and the "schema-tests" job will use Node.js 8 to run the tests. The notifications are set to send on failure and success.

Please note that the Slack notification token is set to `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`, which is a special GitHub token that has permissions to read and write to the repository. If you want to use a different token, you should create a new GitHub token with the necessary permissions and add it to your repository secrets.

Also, please ensure that the Python and Node.js versions you're using are compatible with your project.
