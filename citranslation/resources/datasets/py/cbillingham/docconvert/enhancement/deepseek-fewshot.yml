Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  pull_request:

jobs:
  unit:
    name: "Py:${{ matrix.python-version }}"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version:
          - "3.8"
          - "3.9"
          - "3.10"
    steps:
      - name: Checkout source code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

      - name: Install tox
        run: pip install tox

      - name: Run unit tests
        run: tox -e py

name: Python package

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python: ["3.8"]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python }}
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install tox
      - name: Test with tox
        run: |
          tox -e py

name: Crossplane CI

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    paths-ignore:
      - '**.md'

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", pypy-3.6, pypy-3.7, pypy-3.8, pypy-3.9]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      - name: Run tox under Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        run: |
          pip install tox
          tox -e py  
```

Please note that the GitHub Actions configuration is not exactly the same as the Travis CI configuration. The GitHub Actions configuration is more verbose and includes more steps to set up the environment and run the tests. Also, the Python versions in the matrix in the GitHub Actions configuration are not the same as in the Travis CI configuration. The GitHub Actions configuration uses the Python versions that are available in the GitHub Actions environment, while the Travis CI configuration uses the Python versions that are specified in the `.travis.yml` file.
