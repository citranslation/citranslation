Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Python package

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, 3.10]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install tox
    - name: Test with tox
      run: |
        tox
```

This GitHub Actions configuration does the following:

- It triggers on push and pull request events to the master branch.
- It runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.
- It sets up Python versions 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10.
- It checks out the repository.
- It sets up the Python environment.
- It installs the dependencies (pip and tox).
- It runs the tox command to test the project.
