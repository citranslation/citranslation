Here is the GitHub Action configuration equivalent to the provided Travis CI configuration:

```yaml
name: Build & Test

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master, develop ]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, edited, reopened]
    branches: [ master, develop ]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install tox tox-gh-actions
    - name: Test with tox
      run: tox
|End-of-Code|
```

This GitHub Action configuration does the following:

- It triggers on `push`, `pull_request`, and `workflow_dispatch` events.
- It runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.
- It uses a matrix strategy to test Python 3.8 and 3.9.
- It checks out the repository.
- It sets up the Python environment.
- It installs the necessary dependencies (`tox` and `tox-gh-actions`).
- It runs the `tox` command to test the project.
