Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Python package

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python 3.8
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8

    - name: Set up Python 3.9
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.9

    - name: Cache pip
      uses: actions/cache@v2
      with:
        path: ~/.cache/pip
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/poetry.lock.json') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-pip-

    - name: Install Poetry
      run: pip install poetry

    - name: Install tox
      run: pip install tox-gh-actions

    - name: Test with tox
      run: tox

```

Please note that the `dist: noble` directive in Travis CI is not recognized in GitHub Actions. The `sudo: false` directive is not necessary in GitHub Actions as it is the default behavior.
