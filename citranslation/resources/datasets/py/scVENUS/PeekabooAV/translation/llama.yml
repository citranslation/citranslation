Here is the migrated GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Python Tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10"]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install aiosqlite
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          cd tests
         ./test.py
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that in GitHub Actions, we use a `matrix` strategy to run the tests for multiple Python versions. We also use the `actions/checkout` action to checkout the code, and the `run` keyword to execute the commands.
