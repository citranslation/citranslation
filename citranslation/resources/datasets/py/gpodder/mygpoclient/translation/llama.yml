Here is the migrated GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install simplejson minimock coverage
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          make test
      - name: Deploy to PyPI
        env:
          PYPI_USERNAME: "gpodder"
          PYPI_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PYPI_PASSWORD }}
        run: |
          python -m twine upload dist/*
      - name: Upload coverage report
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v2
        with:
          file: coverage.xml
          token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that I've made the following changes:

* Replaced the `install` and `script` sections with separate `steps` in the `jobs` section.
* Replaced the `deploy` section with a separate `Deploy to PyPI` step, which uses the `twine` command to upload the package to PyPI.
* Replaced the `password` secure variable with an environment variable `PYPI_PASSWORD` that is stored as a secret in GitHub Actions.
* Added a `Upload coverage report` step using the `codecov` action to upload the coverage report to Codecov.
* Set the `runs-on` environment to `ubuntu-latest` to use a Linux environment for the job.
* Set the `on` section to trigger the job on push and pull request events for the `main` branch.
