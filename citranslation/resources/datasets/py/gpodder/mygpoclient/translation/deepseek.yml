Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Python package

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python 3.8
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8
    - name: Set up Python 3.9
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.9
    - name: Set up Python nightly
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 'nightly'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install simplejson minimock coverage
    - name: Run tests
      run: make test

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags')
    steps:
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.x
    - name: Publish package to PyPI
      if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags')
      uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
      with:
        user: ${{ secrets.PYPI_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.PYPI_PASSWORD }}
```

Please replace `${{ secrets.PYPI_USERNAME }}` and `${{ secrets.PYPI_PASSWORD }}` with your actual PyPI username and password. These should be set in your GitHub repository settings as secrets.

Note: GitHub Actions does not support running tests and deploying to PyPI directly from the configuration file. You would need to add the appropriate commands to your Makefile or Python script to run the tests and deploy to PyPI.
