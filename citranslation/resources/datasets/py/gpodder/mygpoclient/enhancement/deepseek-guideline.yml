Please replace `PYPI_PASSWORD` with your actual password in the secrets section of your GitHub repository settings.

Note: The above GitHub Action configuration assumes that you have a `make test` command in your project to run your tests. If you don't have a `make test` command, you can replace the `Test with make` step with a command that runs your tests.

Also, the `deploy` job is set to run only after the `build` job has completed successfully. If you want the `deploy` job to run regardless of the result of the `build` job, you can remove the `needs: build` line.

This is a basic migration and might need adjustments based on your project's specific needs.
