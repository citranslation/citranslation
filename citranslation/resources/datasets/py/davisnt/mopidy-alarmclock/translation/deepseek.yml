Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Travis CI to GitHub Actions

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

    - name: Mock Python gi package
      run: |
        export PYUSRSITEDIR=$(python -m site --user-site)
        mkdir -p $PYUSRSITEDIR
        echo "import sys; import mock; sys.modules['gi'] = mock.Mock(); sys.modules['gi.repository'] = mock.Mock(); sys.modules['gi.repository'].Gst.version.side_effect = lambda: (1, 14, 0)" > ${PYUSRSITEDIR}/usercustomize.py

    - name: Install tox
      run: pip install tox

    - name: Run tox
      run: tox -e ${{ matrix.tox-env }}

    - name: Run coveralls
      if: matrix.tox-env == 'py38'
      run: |
        pip install coveralls requests
        coveralls
```

Please note that GitHub Actions does not support the `dist: noble` directive in the Travis CI configuration. The `ubuntu-latest` environment is equivalent to the `os: linux` directive in Travis CI. The `python: "3.8"` directive in Travis CI is automatically handled by the `actions/setup-python@v2` step. The `env` directive in Travis CI is handled by the `strategy.matrix` directive in GitHub Actions. The `before_install`, `install`, and `script` directives in Travis CI are translated into separate `run` steps in GitHub Actions. The `after_success` directive in Travis CI is handled by the `if: matrix.tox-env == 'py38'` condition in the `Run coveralls` step.
