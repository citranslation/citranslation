Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install tox
    - name: Test with tox
      run: tox

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags')
    steps:
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install twine
    - name: Deploy to PyPI
      env:
        TWINE_USERNAME: fetzerch
        TWINE_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.PYPI_PASSWORD }}
      run: |
        twine upload dist/*
```

Please replace `${{ secrets.PYPI_PASSWORD }}` with your actual PyPI password. You can add this in your GitHub repository settings -> Secrets -> New repository secret.

Note: GitHub Actions are not as flexible as Travis CI for specifying environments and stages. The above configuration assumes a similar workflow to the Travis CI configuration you provided, with separate jobs for building and deploying.
