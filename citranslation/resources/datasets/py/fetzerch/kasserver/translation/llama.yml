Here is the migrated GitHub Action configuration:
```
name: Python CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python: ["3.8", "3.9"]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install tox
      - name: Run tests
        run: tox
      - name: Deploy to PyPI
        if: github.ref =='refs/tags/v*'
        uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@v1
        with:
          user: fetzerch
          password: ${{ secrets.PYPI_PASSWORD }}
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - name: Coveralls
        if: github.ref =='refs/tags/v*'
        uses: coveralls/action@v2
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          service-name: my-service
          service-version: ${{ github.ref }}
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that I've made the following changes:

* Replaced the `dist` and `language` fields with the `name` field.
* Replaced the `install` and `script` fields with separate `steps` in the `jobs` section.
* Replaced the `env` field with the `matrix` strategy in the `jobs` section.
* Replaced the `after_success` field with an `if` statement in the `Deploy to PyPI` step.
* Replaced the `deploy` field with a separate `Deploy to PyPI` step.
* Replaced the `secure` field with a `secrets` field in the `Deploy to PyPI` step.
* Replaced the `coveralls` field with a separate `Coveralls` step.
* Removed the `stage` field, as it is not needed in GitHub Actions.
* Removed the `python` field in the `deploy` step, as it is not needed in GitHub Actions.
