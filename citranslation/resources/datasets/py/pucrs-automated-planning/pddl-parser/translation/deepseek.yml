Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Travis CI to GitHub Actions

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9]
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        python test_PDDL.py
        python test_planner.py
    - name: Run examples
      run: |
        python action.py
        python PDDL.py examples/dinner/dinner.pddl examples/dinner/pb1.pddl
        python planner.py examples/dinner/dinner.pddl examples/dinner/pb1.pddl
        python planner.py examples/airport/airport.pddl examples/airport/pb1.pddl
```

Please note that this is a basic conversion and might need to be adjusted based on your specific project requirements. For example, you might need to install specific dependencies or run specific commands based on your project's setup.
