Here is the migrated GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python:
          - 3.8
          - 3.9
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python }}
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          python test_PDDL.py
          python test_planner.py
      - name: Run examples
        run: |
          python action.py
          python PDDL.py examples/dinner/dinner.pddl examples/dinner/pb1.pddl
          python planner.py examples/dinner/dinner.pddl examples/dinner/pb1.pddl
          python planner.py examples/airport/airport.pddl examples/airport/pb1.pddl
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that I've used the `ubuntu-latest` environment, and the `matrix` strategy to run the tests and examples for both Python 3.8 and 3.9. I've also used the `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-python` actions to checkout the code and install Python, respectively. The `pip install` command is used to install dependencies from a `requirements.txt` file (which you'll need to create). The rest of the steps are similar to the Travis CI configuration.
