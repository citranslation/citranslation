Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install coveralls
          pip install.
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          python test.py
          python setup.py check --strict --metadata
          coverage run --source=nativetypes test.py
      - name: Generate coverage report
        run: |
          coveralls
      - name: Upload coverage report
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1
        with:
          file: coverage.xml
```
