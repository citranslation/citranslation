Here is the migrated GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python:
          - 3.8
    env:
      TOXENV: ${{ matrix.python }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install -g elm
      - name: Install tox
        run: pip install tox
      - name: Run tests
        run: tox
      - name: Generate coverage report
        run: coveralls
    outputs:
      coverage: ${{ steps.coveralls.outputs.coverage }}
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that in GitHub Actions, we use a `jobs` section to define the workflow, and within that, we define a `build` job that runs on an `ubuntu-latest` environment. We use a `matrix` strategy to run the tests for multiple Python versions (in this case, just 3.8). We also define an `env` section to set the `TOXENV` environment variable based on the matrix value.

The rest of the steps are similar to the Travis CI configuration: we install dependencies, run the tests with `tox`, and generate a coverage report with `coveralls`. The `outputs` section is used to capture the coverage report output.
