Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        sudo apt-get install npm
        python -m pip install tox-travis
    - name: Test with tox
      run: tox
    - name: Report coverage to Coveralls
      run: coveralls
```

Please note that GitHub Actions does not support Python versions less than 3.7. Also, GitHub Actions does not have a direct equivalent to Travis CI's `env` variable, which is used to specify the environment for the tox tests. You can achieve this by using the `with` keyword in the `run` step.

Also, GitHub Actions does not support the `npm i -g elm` command to install Elm globally. You would need to use a tool like `npm ci` to install the dependencies in the `package.json` file. However, this is beyond the scope of the original Travis CI configuration.

This is a basic conversion and might need to be adjusted based on your specific project requirements.
