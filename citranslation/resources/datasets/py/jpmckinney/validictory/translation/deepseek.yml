Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Python package

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, pypy3.9]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install pytest pytest-cov coveralls
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        py.test --cov validictory --cov-config=.coveragerc
    - name: Coveralls
      run: coveralls
    - name: Notifications
      if: failure()
      uses: dawidd6/action-send-mail@v2
      with:
        server_address: smtp.gmail.com
        server_port: 465
        username: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_PASSWORD }}
        subject: Build failure
        body: Build failed for validictory
        to: dev@jamesturk.net
        from: GitHub Actions
        smtp_debug: true
```

Please replace `EMAIL_USERNAME` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` with your actual Gmail username and password. These are stored as secrets in your GitHub repository settings.

Note: GitHub Actions does not support Python 3.11, 3.12, and PyPy3.9 as of the time of writing this.
