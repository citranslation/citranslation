Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12", "pypy3.9"]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install pytest pytest-cov coveralls
      - name: Run tests
        run: py.test --cov validictory --cov-config=.coveragerc
      - name: Generate coverage report
        uses: coveralls-action/coveralls@v2
      - name: Send notification
        uses: github-actions/notify@v1
        with:
          who: dev@jamesturk.net
          title: CI Build Completed
          message: "CI build completed successfully"
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that in GitHub Actions, we use a `matrix` strategy to run the tests on multiple Python versions, whereas in Travis CI, we used a list of languages. We also use the `coveralls-action/coveralls` action to generate the coverage report, and the `github-actions/notify` action to send a notification.
