Here is the GitHub Action configuration equivalent to the provided Travis CI configuration:

```yaml
name: build

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest]
        python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12", "pypy3.9"]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install pytest pytest-cov coveralls
      - name: Run tests with pytest and coverage
        run: |
          pytest --cov validictory --cov-config=.coveragerc
      - name: Upload coverage reports to Coveralls
        run: coveralls
```

Please note that GitHub Actions does not support running tests on multiple Python versions at once, so the matrix strategy is limited to a single OS and Python version. If you need to test on multiple Python versions, you will need to set up multiple jobs in your GitHub Action configuration.
