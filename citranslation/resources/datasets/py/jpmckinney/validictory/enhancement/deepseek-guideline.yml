Please replace `EMAIL_USERNAME` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` with your actual Gmail username and password. Also, make sure to enable less secure apps in your Google account to allow the email to be sent.

Note: GitHub Actions does not support PyPy as of now. The above configuration only supports Python versions 3.8 to 3.12.
