Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Travis CI to GitHub Actions

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, pypy3.8, pypy2.7]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

    - name: Cache pip
      uses: actions/cache@v2
      with:
        path: ~/.cache/pip
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements.txt') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-pip-

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install tox

    - name: Run tox
      run: tox

    - name: Debug info
      run: python debug-info.py

|End-of-Code|
```

This GitHub Actions configuration does the same thing as your Travis CI configuration. It sets up a matrix of Python versions, caches pip, installs dependencies, runs the tox script, and then runs the debug-info.py script. The configuration is triggered on push and pull request events.
