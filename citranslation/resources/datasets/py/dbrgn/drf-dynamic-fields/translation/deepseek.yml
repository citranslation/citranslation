Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Travis CI to GitHub Actions

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8]
        django-version: ['<2', '<2.1', '<2.2']
        drf-version: ['<3.8', '<3.9']

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

    - name: Install Dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install "Django${{ matrix.django-version }}" "djangorestframework${{ matrix.drf-version }}"

    - name: Run Tests
      run: python runtests.py

|End-of-Code|
```

This GitHub Actions configuration does the same thing as your Travis CI configuration. It sets up a job that runs on every push and pull request, on the latest version of Ubuntu. It uses a matrix strategy to test different combinations of Python, Django, and Django Rest Framework versions. It then checks out the code, sets up the correct Python version, installs the dependencies, and runs the tests.
