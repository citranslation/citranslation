Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration for the provided Travis CI configuration:

```yaml
name: Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12", "pypy3.10"]
        django: ["Django<3.0", "Django<3.2", "Django<4.0", "Django<5.0"]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install "${{ matrix.django }}"
        pip install Markdown
    - name: Tests
      run: |
        python test.py
```

Please note that the Travis CI configuration you provided does not include a requirements.txt file, so I've assumed that you want to install Markdown as a dependency. If you have a specific requirements.txt file, you can replace the `pip install Markdown` line with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Also, the Travis CI configuration you provided does not include a `make` command to build the project, so I've assumed that you want to run `python test.py` as the build command. If you have a specific `make` command, you can replace the `make` line with your command.
