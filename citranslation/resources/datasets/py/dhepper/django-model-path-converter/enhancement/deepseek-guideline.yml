## 1. Input: Travis CI
# Config file for automatic testing at travis-ci.org

language: python
python:
  - 3.10
  - 3.9


# Command to install dependencies, e.g. pip install -r requirements.txt --use-mirrors
install: pip install -U tox-travis

# Command to run tests, e.g. python setup.py test
script: tox

# Assuming you have installed the travis-ci CLI tool, after you
# create the Github repo and add it to Travis, run the
# following command to finish PyPI deployment setup:
# $ travis encrypt --add deploy.password
# deploy:
#   provider: pypi
#   distributions: sdist bdist_wheel
#   user: dhepper
#   password:
#     secure: PLEASE_REPLACE_ME
#   on:
#     tags: true
#     repo: dhepper/django-model-path-converter
#     python: 3.6
## 2. Task:
Migrate the above Travis CI configuration to Github Action. 
## 3. Guideline

- Syntax:
    - Ensure YAML file follows proper syntax, including required symbols, e.g., colons, hyphens, or quotation marks.
    - Verify that GitHub Actions YAML file follows proper indentation and structural conventions.
    - Ensure all used definitions are correctly defined and properly placed.
    - Ensure the value types match their expected format when such fields exist in the source configuration, e.g., the setup-python action expects a single version value, not a list.

- Platform Discrepancy:
    - Translate Travis CI keys only when a clear, direct GitHub Actions equivalent exists. Skip any Travis CI–specific or unsupported keys.
    - Verify that all expressions are properly converted to GitHub Actions syntax, e.g., 'env: TOX_ENV=flake8' to 'TOX_ENV: flake8'.
    - Retain only x64 and arm64 if architectures are explicitly defined; remove all other architectures.
    - Ensure all version numbers are in string format, e.g., Python '3.10'.
    - Explicitly configure fields that are implicitly defaulted in Travis CI as equivalent GitHub Actions steps, e.g., actions/checkout@v4.
    - Ensure all packages are properly installed and configured when present in the Travis CI configuration, e.g., migrate tox-travis to tox-gh-actions if applicable.

- Environment:
    - Ensure all referenced GitHub Actions currently exist; avoid non-existent actions.
    - Ensure all required tokens are properly configured for the migrated steps, e.g., set GITHUB_TOKEN in the coveralls step if such a step exists.

- Logic:
    - Ensure all trigger events are correctly translated, e.g., avoid using tags as the sole trigger event unless the Travis CI configuration explicitly relies on tag-only builds.
    - Ensure all execution orders are correctly translated, e.g., deploy job should be configured with the `needs` parameter to execute after test job.
    - Ensure conditional statements are correctly translated.
    - Do not introduce extra jobs, steps, operating systems, or matrix dimensions beyond those implied by the Travis CI configuration, except where required to faithfully reproduce Travis CI default behavior.
    - Ensure that all transferable steps have been migrated.

## 4. Output: GitHub Action
```yaml

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python 3.10
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:

    - name: Set up Python 3.9
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.9

    - name: Install tox-travis
      run: pip install -U tox-travis

    - name: Run tests
      run: tox

    - name: Deploy to PyPI
      if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags')
      uses: pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1
