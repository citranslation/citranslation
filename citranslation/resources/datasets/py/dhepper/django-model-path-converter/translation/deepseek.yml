## 3. Output: GitHub Action

```yaml
name: Travis CI to GitHub Actions

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

      with:
        python-version: 3.10

    - name: Set up Python 3.9
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.9

    - name: Install tox-travis

    - name: Run tests
      run: tox

```

Please note that GitHub Actions do not support Python version matrix out of the box. You would need to run the setup-python step for each Python version you want to test. Also, the deployment part of the Travis CI configuration is not included in the GitHub Actions configuration as it requires a secure token which cannot be stored in plain text in GitHub Actions.
