Here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Travis CI to GitHub Action

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:${{ matrix.POSTGRES_VERSION }}
        env:
          POSTGRES_USER: postgres
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
          POSTGRES_DB: postgres
        ports: ['5432:5432']
        options: --health-cmd pg_isready --health-interval 10s --health-timeout 5s --health-retries 5

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11]
        postgres-version: [12, 13, 14, 15]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install docker-compose
    - name: Build
      run: docker-compose build
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: docker-compose run --entrypoint="pytest tests" nycdb

```

Please note that the GitHub Actions configuration is different from Travis CI configuration. The GitHub Actions configuration above uses the `services` keyword to set up a PostgreSQL service, which is not available in Travis CI. Also, the Python versions and PostgreSQL versions are defined in a matrix strategy, which is similar to the `jobs.include` section in Travis CI.
