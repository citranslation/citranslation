Here is the GitHub Action configuration equivalent to the provided Travis CI configuration:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ['3.8', '3.9', '3.10', '3.11']
      fail-fast: false
    name: Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Upgrade pip
      run: pip install -U pip
    - name: Install dev dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    - name: Run tests
      run: pytest -v
    - name: Upload coverage reports to Codecov
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v5
      with:
        fail_ci_if_error: false
        token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
|End-of-Code|
```

This GitHub Action configuration will trigger on every push and pull request to the master branch. It will run the tests on Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11. After running the tests, it will upload the coverage reports to Codecov.
