Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, 3.10]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install codecov
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        pip install -r test-requirements.txt

    - name: Lint with flake8
      run: flake8 stockstats.py test.py

    - name: Test with pytest
      run: pytest --cov=./ test.py

    - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
      run: codecov

    - name: Notify
      if: failure()
      uses: dawidd6/action-send-mail@v2
      with:
        server_address: smtp.163.com
        server_port: 465
        username: YOUR_EMAIL
        password: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_PASSWORD }}
        subject: Build failure
        body: |
          Build failed for ${{ github.repository }}
          Commit: ${{ github.sha }}
        to: jealous@163.com
```

Please replace `YOUR_EMAIL` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` with your actual email and password. These should be stored as secrets in your GitHub repository settings.

This GitHub Actions configuration does the following:

- It triggers on push and pull request events.
- It runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.
- It sets up Python 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10.
- It installs the necessary dependencies.
- It runs flake8 to lint the code.
- It runs pytest with coverage.
- It uploads the coverage report to Codecov.
- If the build fails, it sends an email notification.
