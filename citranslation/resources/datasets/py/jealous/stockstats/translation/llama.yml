Here is the migrated GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Python CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install Python
        run: |
          python3.8 -m venv venv
          source venv/bin/activate
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install codecov
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install -r test-requirements.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          flake8 stockstats.py test.py
          pytest --cov=./ test.py
      - name: Generate coverage report
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v2
      - name: Send notification
        uses: github-actions/notify@v1
        with:
          personal-topics: "jealous@163.com"
    environment:
      python: "3.8"
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that I've used the `ubuntu-latest` environment, which is similar to the `xenial` environment in Travis CI. I've also used the `python3.8` command to install Python 3.8, and the `venv` package to create a virtual environment. The rest of the steps are similar to the original Travis CI configuration.
