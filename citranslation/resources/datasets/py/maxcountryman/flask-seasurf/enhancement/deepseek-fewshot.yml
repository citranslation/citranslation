Here is the GitHub Action configuration equivalent to the provided Travis CI configuration:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  pull_request:    

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.8"]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install xrandr
        run: sudo apt-get install -y x11-xserver-utils
      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
          architecture: x64
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install flask nose mock
      - name: Run tests
        run: python setup.py test
```

Please note that the Travis CI configuration you provided does not include the installation of any specific dependencies, so I have included the common Python testing dependencies (flask, nose, mock) in the GitHub Action configuration.

Also, the Travis CI configuration you provided does not specify any specific Python version, so I have used "3.8" as the default Python version in the GitHub Action configuration.
