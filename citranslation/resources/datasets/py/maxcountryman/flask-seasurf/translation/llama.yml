Here is the migrated GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Python CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install flask
          pip install nose
          pip install mock
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          python setup.py test
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that in GitHub Actions, we use the `on` keyword to specify the event that triggers the workflow (in this case, a push to the `main` branch). We then define a `jobs` section, which contains a single job named `test`. The `runs-on` keyword specifies the environment in which the job will run (in this case, an `ubuntu-latest` environment). The `steps` section contains the individual steps that make up the job. In this case, we have three steps: checking out the code, installing dependencies, and running the tests.
