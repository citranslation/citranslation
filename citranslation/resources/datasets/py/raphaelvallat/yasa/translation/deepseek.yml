Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Python package

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        pip install -r requirements-test.txt
        pip install .
        echo "NUMBA_DISABLE_JIT=1" >> $GITHUB_ENV
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        pytest
    - name: Report coverage to Codecov
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
    - name: Send notification email
      uses: dawidd6/action-send-mail@v2
      with:
        server_address: smtp.gmail.com
        server_port: 465
        username: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_PASSWORD }}
        subject: Travis CI Notification
        body: Build completed
        to: raphaelvallat9@gmail.com
        from: Github Action
        smtp_ssl: true
```

Please replace `${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}` and `${{ secrets.EMAIL_USERNAME }}`, `${{ secrets.EMAIL_PASSWORD }}` with your actual secrets.

Note: The email notification part is using Gmail SMTP server. You may need to allow less secure apps to access your account or use OAuth2.0 for more secure access.

Also, please ensure that you have set up the secrets in your GitHub repository settings.
