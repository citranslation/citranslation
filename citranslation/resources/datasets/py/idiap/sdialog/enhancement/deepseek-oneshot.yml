Here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: build
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version:
          - '3.8'
          - '3.9'
          - '3.10'
    steps:
      - name: 'Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}'
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '${{ matrix.python-version }}'
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - run: pip install pytest pytest-cov
      - run: pip install coverage
      - run: pytest --cov=./
      - run: 'bash <(curl -s https://codecov.io/bash)'
```

Please note that the `runs-on` field in the GitHub Action configuration is set to `ubuntu-latest`, which is the latest version of Ubuntu available as of the time of writing this response. If you need to use a specific version of Ubuntu, you can replace `ubuntu-latest` with the version number you need.

Also, please ensure that the Python versions you want to test are available in the GitHub Actions environment. If they are not, you may need to use a different runner or install the necessary dependencies manually.
