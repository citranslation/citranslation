Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Python application

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python 3.10
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.10

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Lint with flake8
      run: |
        flake8 --ignore=E501,W503

    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        pytest -v --cov-report=xml --cov=src/sdialog

    - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v2

|End-of-Code|
```

This GitHub Action configuration does the following:

1. It triggers on push and pull request events.
2. It runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.
3. It checks out your repository.
4. It sets up Python 3.10.
5. It installs the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
6. It runs `flake8` with the specified ignore options.
7. It runs `pytest` with coverage reporting.
8. It uses the `codecov-action` to upload the coverage report to Codecov.
