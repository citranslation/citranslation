Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Python 3.10 on Linux

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python 3.10
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.10
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip3 install -r requirements.txt || pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run flake8
        run: |
          flake8 --ignore=E501,W503
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest -v --cov-report=xml --cov=src/sdialog
      - name: Upload coverage report
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v2
        with:
          file: coverage.xml
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that I've used the `ubuntu-latest` environment, which is a pre-built environment that comes with Python 3.10 installed. I've also used the `actions/checkout` action to check out the code, and the `actions/setup-python` action to set up Python 3.10. The rest of the steps are similar to the Travis CI configuration.
