Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Travis CI to GitHub Actions

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11]
        arch: [x64, ppc64le]
        without-extension: [0, 1]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        architecture: ${{ matrix.arch }}

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install coveralls pytest
        python setup.py develop

    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        coverage run --source=mwparserfromhell -m pytest

    - name: Report coverage to coveralls
      run: coveralls

    - name: Set env variable
      run: echo "WITHOUT_EXTENSION=${{ matrix.without-extension }}" >> $GITHUB_ENV

|End-of-Code|
```

This GitHub Actions configuration does the following:

1. It triggers on push and pull request events.
2. It runs on different operating systems (Ubuntu, MacOS, Windows), Python versions (3.8 to 3.11), architectures (x64, ppc64le), and WITHOUT_EXTENSION values (0 and 1).
3. It checks out the repository.
4. It sets up the Python environment.
5. It installs the necessary dependencies.
6. It runs the tests.
7. It reports the coverage to coveralls.
8. It sets the environment variable WITHOUT_EXTENSION.
