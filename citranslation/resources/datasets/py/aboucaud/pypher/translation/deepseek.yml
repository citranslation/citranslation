Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Python package

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python 3.8
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8

    - name: Set up Python 3.9
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.9

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install pytest-cov
        pip install scipy

    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        py.test

|End-of-Code|
```

Please note that GitHub Actions does not support the `sudo: false` directive, as it runs on a virtual environment provided by GitHub. Also, GitHub Actions does not support the `env` directive to set environment variables globally. Instead, you can set environment variables in the `steps` where they are used.

The `addons` section in your Travis CI configuration is not supported in GitHub Actions. You can use other tools like Codecov to report coverage.

This configuration will trigger the workflow on every push and pull request to the repository. If you want to restrict it to only trigger on certain branches, you can add a `branches` field to the `on` directive.
