Here is the GitHub Action configuration equivalent to the provided Travis CI configuration:

```yaml
name: ci

on: [push, pull_request, workflow_dispatch]

jobs:
  test:
    name: Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10"]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
          cache: pip

      - name: Install test deps
        run: |
          python3 -m pip install -U pip
          python3 -m pip install -U wheel
          python3 -m pip install -U coverage mypy
      - name: Install project deps
        run: python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          python3 -m coverage run --branch -m unittest discover -t . -s ni/test/
          python3 -m coverage xml -o ./coverage.xml

      - name: Run mypy
        run: python3 -m mypy ni/*.py
        
      - uses: codecov/codecov-action@v2
        with:
          file: ./coverage.xml  

|End-of-Code|
```

This GitHub Action configuration is set to run on every push, pull request, and manual workflow dispatch. It uses the `setup-python` action to set up Python, installs the necessary dependencies, runs the tests, and generates a coverage report. The coverage report is then uploaded to Codecov.
