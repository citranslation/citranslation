# This is a GitHub Action workflow that was migrated from the provided Travis CI configuration.
name: Python CI

# This workflow is triggered on pushes or pull requests to the master branch 
# or any branch starting with 'releases/'. This is equivalent to the Travis CI 'branches' configuration.

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Sets the timezone for all steps in the job, equivalent to 'export TZ=Asia/Seoul'
    env:
      TZ: Asia/Seoul

    steps:
      # 1. Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it.
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Sets up the Python 3.6 environment, equivalent to 'language: python' and 'python: 3.6'.
      - name: Set up Python 3.6
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: 3.6

      # 3. Installs dependencies, combining steps from 'before_install' and 'install'.

        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install codecov

        run: |
          coverage run --omit="*/test*" -m unittest discover ./tests/ *test.py

      - name: Upload coverage to Codecov

        # Note on notifications: GitHub Actions has built-in notifications. By default, it notifies 
        # the user who initiated the workflow on failure. This behavior is similar to the Travis CI
        # 'notifications: email: on_failure: change' setting. Success notifications are not sent by default.
