Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Travis CI to GitHub Actions

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
      - /releases\/.+/

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set timezone
      run: |
        sudo timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Seoul

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install codecov
        pip install -e .[dev]

    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        coverage run --omit="*/test*" -m unittest discover ./tests/ *test.py

    - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1

|End-of-Code|
```

Please note that GitHub Actions is a bit different from Travis CI. For example, Travis CI has a `before_install` step that is equivalent to the `setup-python` and `install` steps in the GitHub Actions configuration. Also, the `script` step in Travis CI is equivalent to the `run` step in GitHub Actions.
