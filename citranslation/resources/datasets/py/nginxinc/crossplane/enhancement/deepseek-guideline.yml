Please note that the `tox-gh-actions` package does not exist, so I used `tox` as it is the closest equivalent in GitHub Actions. Also, the `setup-python` action is used to set up the Python environment, and the `pip install` command is used to install the dependencies. The `actions/checkout@v2` step is used to checkout the repository. The `runs-on` field specifies the type of machine to run on, and the `matrix` field is used to run the job for multiple Python versions.
