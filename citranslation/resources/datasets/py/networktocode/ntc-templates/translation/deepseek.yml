Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python 3.8
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        python -m pip install poetry
        poetry install
    - name: Run linters
      run: |
        poetry run tox -e black
        poetry run tox -e flake8
        poetry run tox -e yamllint

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python 3.8
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        python -m pip install poetry
        poetry install
    - name: Run tests
      run: poetry run tox -e py38,py39,py310

  deploy-github:
    needs: test
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python 3.8
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        python -m pip install poetry
    - name: Bump version and build
      run: |
        poetry version ${{ github.ref_name }}
        poetry build
    - name: Release
      uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        files: dist/*

  deploy-pypi:
    needs: test
    if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python 3.8
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        python -m pip install poetry
    - name: Bump version
      run: poetry version ${{ github.ref_name }}
    - name: Publish to PyPI
      run: poetry publish --build -u __token__ -p ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
```

Please replace `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` and `${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}` with your actual secrets.

This GitHub Actions configuration does the same thing as your Travis CI configuration. It runs linting and testing jobs on push and pull request events, and deploys to GitHub Releases and PyPI when a tag is pushed.
