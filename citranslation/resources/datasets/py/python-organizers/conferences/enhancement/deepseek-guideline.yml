This GitHub Action configuration follows the guidelines you provided. It sets up a build job that runs on the latest version of Ubuntu, checks out the repository, sets up Python 3.11, installs the dependencies listed in `linting/requirements.txt`, and runs the linting script. The build job is triggered on every push and pull request.
