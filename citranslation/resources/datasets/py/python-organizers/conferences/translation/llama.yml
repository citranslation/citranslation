Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```yaml
name: Linting

on: [push]

jobs:
  linting:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r linting/requirements.txt
      - name: Run linting
        run: |
          python./linting/lint-csv.py
```
