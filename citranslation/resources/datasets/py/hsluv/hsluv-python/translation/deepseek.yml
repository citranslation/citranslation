Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Python package

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python 3.8
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install .

    - name: Build and test
      run: |
        python setup.py sdist
        cd dist/
        tar xf hsluv-*.tar.gz
        cd hsluv-*/
        python setup.py test
      |End-of-Code|
```

This configuration will trigger the workflow on every push and pull request to the repository. It sets up the Python environment, installs the dependencies, and runs the build and test commands.
