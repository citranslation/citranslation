Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Travis CI to GitHub Actions

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 'pypy3.10']

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install Markdown
    - name: Run tests
      run: python test.py
```

Please note that the `dist: noble` line in your Travis CI configuration is not recognized by GitHub Actions. The `dist:` parameter is used to specify the type of Linux distribution to use, and GitHub Actions uses a variety of different Linux distributions by default.

Also, please ensure that your `test.py` script is in the root directory of your repository, as GitHub Actions will run this script from the root directory.
