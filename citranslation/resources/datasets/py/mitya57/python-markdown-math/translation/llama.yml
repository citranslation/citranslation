Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Python Tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python: ["3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "3.12", "pypy3.10"]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install Markdown
      - name: Run tests
        run: python test.py
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that in GitHub Actions, we use a `matrix` strategy to run the tests on multiple Python versions, whereas in Travis CI, we used a list of Python versions. We also use the `ubuntu-latest` environment, which is equivalent to the `noble` environment in Travis CI.
