Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Python application

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python 3.8
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install .[dev]

    - name: Run tox
      run: tox

```

This configuration will trigger the workflow on every push and pull request to the repository. It sets up the Python environment, installs the dependencies, and runs the tox command.
