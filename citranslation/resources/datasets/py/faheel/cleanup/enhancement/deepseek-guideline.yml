This GitHub Action configuration is based on the Travis CI configuration you provided. It sets up a workflow that runs on every push and pull request to the master branch. The workflow runs on the latest version of Ubuntu, and it uses a matrix strategy to test the Python versions 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12. It checks out the code, sets up Python, installs pipenv, installs the dependencies, and runs the tests.
