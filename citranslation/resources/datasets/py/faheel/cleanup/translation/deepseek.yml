Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Travis CI to GitHub Actions

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.10, 3.11, 3.12]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install pipenv
      run: pip install --upgrade pipenv
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pipenv --three
        pipenv install --dev
    - name: Run tests
      run: python3 -m tests.test
```

Please note that the `dist: noble` line in your Travis CI configuration is not recognized by GitHub Actions. The `dist:` parameter is used to specify the type of Linux distribution to use, and GitHub Actions uses a variety of different Linux distributions by default.

Also, please ensure that the `tests.test` command in your Travis CI configuration is correct. If it's not, you'll need to adjust the `run` command in the GitHub Actions configuration accordingly.
