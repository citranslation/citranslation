Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10"]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install -r test_requirements.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: make test
```
