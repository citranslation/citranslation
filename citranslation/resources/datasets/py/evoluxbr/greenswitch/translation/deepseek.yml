Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Python package

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, 3.10]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        pip install -r test_requirements.txt
    - name: Test with make
      run: |
        make test
```

This GitHub Action configuration does the following:

1. It triggers on push and pull request events.
2. It runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.
3. It sets up Python versions 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9.
4. It checks out your repository.
5. It installs the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` and `test_requirements.txt`.
6. It runs the `make test` command to test your project.

Please note that the `make test` command is assumed to be a command that is available in your project. If it's not, you'll need to replace it with the appropriate command.
