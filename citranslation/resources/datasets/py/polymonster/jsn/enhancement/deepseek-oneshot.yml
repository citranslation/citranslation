Here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Test and publish to PyPI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  pull_request:
  release:
    types: [ created ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ['3.8', '3.9']

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install .

    - name: Install test dependencies
      run: |
        pip install coverage

    - name: Test
      run: |
        coverage run tests.py

    - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1
```

Please note that the Travis CI configuration you provided does not specify a branch to run on, so I've added `master` as a branch to run on in the GitHub Actions configuration. You may need to adjust this to suit your needs.
