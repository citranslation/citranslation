Here is the GitHub Action configuration equivalent to the provided Travis CI configuration:

```yaml
name: Test and publish to PyPI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  pull_request:
  release:
    types: [ created ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ['3.8', '3.9']

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: 'Set up Python ${{matrix.python-version}}'
      uses: actions/setup-python@v3
      with:
        python-version: ${{matrix.python-version}}

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        
    - name: Install my package
      run: |
        python -m pip install .

    - name: Install test dependencies
      run: |
        pip install coverage

    - name: Test
      run: |
        coverage run tests.py

    - uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1

|End-of-Code|
```

Please note that the GitHub Action configuration for the second example is not provided in the question as it seems to be missing some parts.
