Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Travis CI to GitHub Action

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python 3.8
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install codecov
        pip install coverage

    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        coverage run jsn.py -i example.jsn -o test.json -I import_dir

    - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
      run: codecov

|End-of-Code|
```

This GitHub Action configuration does the following:

1. It triggers on push and pull request events.
2. It sets up the latest version of Ubuntu as the environment to run the job.
3. It checks out the repository.
4. It sets up Python 3.6.
5. It installs the necessary dependencies (`codecov` and `coverage`).
6. It runs the test script (`jsn.py`).
7. It uploads the coverage report to Codecov.
