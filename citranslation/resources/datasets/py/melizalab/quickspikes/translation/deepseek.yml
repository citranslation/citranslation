Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Travis CI to GitHub Actions

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: '3.8'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Install pytest
      run: pip install pytest

    - name: Install package in editable mode
      run: pip install -e .

    - name: Run tests
      run: pytest -v

    - name: Notify on Slack
      if: ${{ failure() }}
      uses: rtCamp/action-slack-notify@v2
      env:
        SLACK_WEBHOOK: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
        SLACK_CHANNEL: ${{ secrets.SLACK_CHANNEL }}
        SLACK_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.SLACK_USERNAME }}
        SLACK_ICON: ${{ secrets.SLACK_ICON }}
        SLACK_MESSAGE: "Build failed for ${{ github.repository }}"
```

Please note that the Slack notification part is a bit tricky. In Travis CI, the secure environment variable is used to store the Slack webhook URL. In GitHub Actions, you can use the `secrets` context to use the same URL. You need to add the Slack webhook URL as a secret in your GitHub repository settings.

Also, the `dist: noble` line in your Travis CI configuration does not have a corresponding action in GitHub Actions. I've assumed you meant `ubuntu-latest` as the environment for running the build. If you have a specific distribution in mind, you may need to use a different runner.
