Here is the migrated GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Build and Test

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.8

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install sphinx==3.2.1 pyspark==3.0.1 tensorflow-cpu==1.15.0

      - name: Build documentation
        run: |
          pushd docs/ && PYTHONPATH=.. make clean html && popd

      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest

|End-of-Code|
```
Note that I've used the `actions/checkout` action to check out the code, and the `actions/setup-python` action to set up the Python environment. I've also used the `pip install` command to install the dependencies, and the `run` command to execute the build and test steps.
