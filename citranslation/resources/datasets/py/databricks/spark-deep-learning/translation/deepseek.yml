Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python 3.8
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install sphinx==3.2.1 pyspark==3.0.1 tensorflow-cpu==1.15.0

    - name: Build the docs
      run: |
        pushd docs/
        PYTHONPATH=.. make clean html
        popd

    - name: Test with pytest
      run: pytest

|End-of-Code|
```

This configuration will trigger the workflow on every push and pull request to the master branch. It will use the latest version of Ubuntu to run the jobs, set up Python 3.9, install the required dependencies, build the documentation, and run the tests with pytest.
