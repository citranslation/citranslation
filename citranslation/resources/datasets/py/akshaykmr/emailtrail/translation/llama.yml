Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Python CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.9
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: make setup
      - name: Run tests
        run: make test
```
