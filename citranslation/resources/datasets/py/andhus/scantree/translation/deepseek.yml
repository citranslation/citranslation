Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Python package

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install tox codecov
    - name: Test with tox
      run: |
        tox
    - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
      run: |
        codecov

notifications:
  email:
    on_success: never
    on_failure: always

|End-of-Code|
```

This GitHub Actions configuration does the same thing as your Travis CI configuration. It sets up a matrix of Python versions, installs the necessary dependencies, runs the tests with tox, and uploads the coverage to Codecov. The `on` section specifies that the workflow should run on push and pull request events.
