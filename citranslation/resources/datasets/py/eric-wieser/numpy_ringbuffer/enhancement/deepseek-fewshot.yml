Here is the GitHub Action configuration equivalent to the Travis CI configuration you provided:

```yaml
name: ci

on: [push, pull_request, workflow_dispatch]

jobs:
  test:
    name: Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10"]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
          cache: pip
      - name: Install test deps
        run: |
          python3 -m pip install -U pip
          python3 -m pip install -U wheel
          python3 -m pip install -U coverage mypy
      - name: Install project deps
        run: python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          python3 -m coverage run --branch -m unittest discover -t . -s ni/test/
          python3 -m coverage xml -o ./coverage.xml
      - name: Run mypy
        run: python3 -m mypy ni/*.py
      - uses: codecov/codecov-action@v2
        with:
          file: ./coverage.xml
|End-of-Code|
```

Please note that the GitHub Actions configuration is slightly different from the Travis CI configuration. For instance, the `dist` and `python` versions in Travis CI are not used in the GitHub Actions configuration. Also, the `before_install` and `install` steps in Travis CI are combined into a single `Install test deps` step in GitHub Actions.
