Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Travis CI to GitHub Actions

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, pypy3.7]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        pip install .

    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        tox -e ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        pytest --dead-fixtures

    - name: Cache pip
      uses: actions/cache@v2
      with:
        path: ~/.cache/pip
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements-dev.txt') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-pip-

|End-of-Code|
```

This GitHub Actions configuration does the same thing as the Travis CI configuration you provided. It sets up a workflow that runs on every push and pull request, and for each Python version specified in the matrix, it installs the dependencies, runs the tests, and caches the pip environment.
