Here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [pull_request, push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        python: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "pypy-2.7", "pypy-3.8"]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      with:
        submodules: true

    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python }}
        cache: pip
        cache-dependency-path: "requirements*.txt"

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install tox

    - name: Run tests
      run: tox -e py

    - name: Debug info
      if: ${{ always() }}
      run: python debug-info.py
```

Please note that the Travis CI configuration you provided is for a specific environment (Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic) and it uses a specific Python versions and a specific Tox environment. GitHub Actions is more flexible and allows you to specify the Python version and the operating system in the matrix strategy.
