Here is the GitHub Action configuration equivalent to the provided Travis CI configuration:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  pull_request:

jobs:
  build:
    name: "Py:${{ matrix.python }}"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11", "pypy-2.7", "pypy-3.8"]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout source code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python }}
          cache: pip
          cache-dependency-path: "requirements*.txt"
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install tox
      - name: Test with tox
        run: tox -e py
      - if: ${{ always() }}
        run: python debug-info.py
```

Please note that the GitHub Actions configuration is slightly different from the Travis CI configuration. The GitHub Actions configuration uses the `actions/checkout@v4` and `actions/setup-python@v5` actions to checkout the source code and setup the Python environment, respectively. The `cache` and `cache-dependency-path` options are also used to cache pip dependencies. The `if: ${{ always() }}` condition is used to run the `python debug-info.py` script regardless of the previous step's outcome.
