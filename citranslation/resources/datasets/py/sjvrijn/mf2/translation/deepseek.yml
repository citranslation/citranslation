Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Python package

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install .[dev]
        pip install coverage coveralls
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        pytest tests/regression_test.py
        pytest -Werror --cov-branch --cov=mf2 tests/property_test.py tests/multi_fidelity_function_test.py
    - name: Coveralls
      run: coveralls

```

This GitHub Action configuration will trigger on every push and pull request to the master branch. It will run on the latest Ubuntu environment and install Python versions from 3.6 to 3.10. It will install the dependencies, run the tests, and report coverage to Coveralls.
