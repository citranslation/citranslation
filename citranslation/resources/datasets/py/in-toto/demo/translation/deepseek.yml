Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Travis CI to GitHub Actions

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, 3.10]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run demo script
      run: |
        python run_demo_md.py
```

This GitHub Actions configuration does the same thing as your Travis CI configuration: it sets up a workflow that runs on every push and pull request, on the latest version of Ubuntu, and for each Python version specified in the matrix (3.8, 3.9, and 3.10). It checks out the repository, sets up the specified Python version, installs the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`, and runs the `run_demo_md.py` script.
