Here is the GitHub Action configuration equivalent to the Travis CI configuration you provided:

```yaml
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Test with Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        python-version: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "pypy3.7"]
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      - name: Install tox
        run: pip install tox
      - name: Run tox
        run: tox
|End-of-Code|
```

This configuration will trigger a test job for each Python version specified in the matrix whenever a push or pull request event occurs on the main branch. The job will checkout the repository, set up the specified Python version, install tox, and run the tox command.
