Please note that the '3.7-dev' version in the matrix is equivalent to 'nightly' in Travis CI, which means it will use the latest Python 3.7 development version. Also, the 'actions/setup-python@v2' action is used to set up the Python environment, and the 'actions/cache@v2' action is used to cache pip. The 'python -m pip install --upgrade pip' command is used to upgrade pip to the latest version. The 'python setup.py install' command is used to install the package. The 'python --version' and 'py.test tests' commands are used to print the Python version and run the tests.
