Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Travis CI to GitHub Actions

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, nightly]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

    - name: Cache pip
      uses: actions/cache@v2
      with:
        path: ~/.cache/pip
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements.txt') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-pip-

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install pytest
        python setup.py install

    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        python --version
        pytest tests

|End-of-Code|
```

This GitHub Actions configuration does the same thing as the Travis CI configuration you provided. It sets up a job that runs on every push and pull request, on the latest version of Ubuntu. It uses the `setup-python` action to set up Python, and the `cache` action to cache the pip cache. It then installs the dependencies and runs the tests.
