Please replace `${{ secrets.PYPI_API_TOKEN }}` with your actual PyPI API token. This token can be created in your PyPI account settings.

Note: GitHub Actions does not support the `sudo: false` directive in the Travis CI configuration. This is because GitHub Actions runs on a virtual environment provided by GitHub, and does not support running as root.

Also, the `deploy` section in the Travis CI configuration is translated to the `gh-action-pypi-publish` action in the GitHub Actions configuration. The `user` and `password` fields are replaced with `user` and `password` secrets, which are set in the GitHub repository settings. The `skip_existing` field is set to `true` to avoid publishing a new version of the package if there is one already published with the same version number.
