# Note on Notifications:
# The 'notifications.slack.secure' key from Travis CI is an encrypted secret
# that cannot be migrated directly. To set up Slack notifications in GitHub Actions,
# you would need to:
# 1. Create a new Slack App with an Incoming Webhook.
# 2. Add the webhook URL as an encrypted secret in your GitHub repository's
#    settings (e.g., named SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL).
# 3. Add a new step to the job that uses a Slack action from the marketplace,
#    conditioned to run on success or failure as needed.
