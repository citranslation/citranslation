Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Travis CI to GitHub Action

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0

    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

    - name: Install tox
      run: pip install tox

    - name: Run tox
      run: tox

    - name: Notify Slack
      if: failure()
      uses: rtCamp/action-slack-notify@v2
      env:
        SLACK_WEBHOOK: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
        SLACK_CHANNEL: notifications
        SLACK_USERNAME: Travis CI
        SLACK_ICON: https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/14946106?s=200&v=4
        SLACK_COLOR: ${{ job.status }}
        SLACK_TITLE: Job ${{ job.status }} for ${{ github.repository }}
        SLACK_MESSAGE: |
          Job ${{ job.status }} for ${{ github.repository }}
          Commit: ${{ github.sha }}
          Author: ${{ github.actor }}
          Message: ${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}
          Repository: ${{ github.repository }}
          Branch: ${{ github.ref }}
      with:
        status: ${{ job.status }}
```

Please replace `SLACK_WEBHOOK` with your actual Slack webhook URL which you can find in your Slack App settings. This URL is a secret and should be stored in your repository settings as a secret.

This GitHub Action configuration does the following:

1. It triggers on push and pull request events.
2. It sets up the Python environment with the specified versions.
3. It installs tox.
4. It runs tox.
5. It notifies Slack if the job fails. The notification includes the job status, the commit, the author, the message, the repository, and the branch.

Please note that the GitHub Actions environment does not support Python 3.11 as of the time of writing this. You may need to use a different CI/CD tool or wait until Python 3.11 is officially supported.
