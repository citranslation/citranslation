Please note that the '3.x-dev' and 'nightly' versions are not supported in GitHub Actions. The '3.10-preview' version is supported, but it's not the same as '3.10-dev' in Travis CI. The 'nightly' version is not supported in GitHub Actions. Therefore, I have replaced '3.10-dev' and 'nightly' with '3.10-preview' in the GitHub Actions configuration.
