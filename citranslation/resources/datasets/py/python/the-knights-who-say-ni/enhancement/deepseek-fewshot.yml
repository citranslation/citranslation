Here is the GitHub Action configuration equivalent to the Travis CI configuration you provided:

```yaml
name: Test and publish to PyPI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  pull_request:
  release:
    types: [ created ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: ['3.8', '3.9']

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: 'Set up Python ${{matrix.python-version}}'
      uses: actions/setup-python@v3
      with:
        python-version: ${{matrix.python-version}}

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install .
        pip install codecov

    - name: Test
      run: |
        coverage run tests.py

    - uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1

|End-of-Code|
```

Please note that the GitHub Actions configuration is slightly different from the Travis CI configuration. The GitHub Actions configuration is more verbose and explicit, which is necessary for the workflow to run correctly. The Travis CI configuration is more concise and implicit, which can make it easier to understand and maintain.
