Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Python application

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, 3.10-dev, nightly]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install -U coverage codecov mypy
        python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        python -m coverage run --branch -m unittest discover -t . -s ni/test/
        python -m mypy ni/*.py
    - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
      run: codecov

|End-of-Code|
```

This GitHub Actions configuration does the following:

1. It triggers on push and pull request events.
2. It runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.
3. It sets up Python versions 3.8, 3.9, 3.10-dev, and nightly.
4. It checks out the repository.
5. It installs the dependencies using pip.
6. It runs the tests using coverage and mypy.
7. It uploads the coverage report to Codecov.
