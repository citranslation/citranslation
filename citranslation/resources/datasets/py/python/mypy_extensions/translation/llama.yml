Here is the migrated GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11"]
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -U pip setuptools
        pip install -U tox
    - name: Cache pip packages
      uses: actions/cache@v2
      with:
        path: ~/.cache/pip
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements.txt') }}
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        tox
    - name: Lint code
      run: |
        TOXENV=lint tox
    - name: Cache pip packages (lint)
      uses: actions/cache@v2
      with:
        path: ~/.cache/pip
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements.txt') }}
    - name: Run lint
      run: |
        tox -e lint
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that I've used the `ubuntu-latest` environment, which is similar to the `noble` environment in Travis CI. I've also used the `actions/cache` action to cache pip packages, and the `tox` command to run the tests and linting. The `TOXENV` environment variable is set to `lint` for the linting step.
