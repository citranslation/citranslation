Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Python package

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python 3.8
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8

    - name: Set up Python 3.9
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.9

    - name: Set up Python nightly
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 'nightly'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        python -m pip install --upgrade wheel setuptools pbr
        python -m pip install --upgrade .[docs,test]
        python -m pip list
        python --version

    - name: Check with make
      run: make check

    - name: Convert README.rst to HTML
      run: rst2html.py README.rst README.html

|End-of-Code|
```

Please note that GitHub Actions does not support running Python versions in parallel, so we have to set up each version separately. Also, the `make check` command is assumed to be available in the environment. If it's not, you might need to adjust the command accordingly.
