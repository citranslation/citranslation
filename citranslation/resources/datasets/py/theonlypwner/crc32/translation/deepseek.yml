Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Python package

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, pypy, pypy3]
        os: [ubuntu-latest]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install coveralls
    - name: Test with coverage
      run: |
        coverage run --branch --source=crc32 test.py
    - name: Report coverage to coveralls
      run: |
        coveralls
```

Please note that GitHub Actions are currently in beta and some features may not be available. Also, the Python versions you specified in the matrix are not officially supported by GitHub Actions. You may need to adjust the Python versions to match the ones that are officially supported by GitHub Actions.
