This GitHub Action configuration will trigger on every push and pull request to the master branch. It will run on the latest Ubuntu environment. It will install the specified Python versions and their dependencies, run the tests with coverage, and report the coverage to coveralls. The `allow_failure` option is set to true for each Python version, meaning that if a job fails, it will not cause the entire workflow to fail.
