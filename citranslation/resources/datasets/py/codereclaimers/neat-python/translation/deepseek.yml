Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Travis CI to GitHub Actions

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, nightly, pypy3.8, pypy3.9, pypy3.10, pypy3.11]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pytest coveralls coverage
        if [[ ${{ matrix.python-version }} == 'pypy'* ]]; then export TRAVIS_WAIT=45; else export TRAVIS_WAIT=20; fi
    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        coverage run --source=neat -m pytest tests
    - name: Coveralls
      run: coveralls

```

Please note that GitHub Actions does not support the `nightly` Python version and PyPy versions. You may need to replace these with specific Python versions that are supported by your project.
