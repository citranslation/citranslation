Here is the migrated GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Python CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python: |
          - 3.8
          - 3.9
          - 3.10
          - 3.11
          - 3.12
          - 3.13
          - nightly
          - pypy3.8
          - pypy3.9
          - pypy3.10
          - pypy3.11

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python }}

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install --upgrade pytest coveralls coverage

      - name: Set wait time
        run: |
          if [[ $TRAVIS_PYTHON_VERSION == 'pypy'* ]]; then export TRAVIS_WAIT=45; else export TRAVIS_WAIT=20; fi

      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pwd
          coverage run --source=neat -m pytest tests

      - name: Generate coverage report
        uses: coveralls-action/coveralls@v2
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          file: coverage.xml

|End-of-Code|
```
Note that I've used the `ubuntu-latest` environment, and the `matrix` strategy to run the tests for multiple Python versions. I've also used the `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-python` actions to checkout the code and set up the Python environment, respectively. The rest of the steps are similar to the original Travis CI configuration.
