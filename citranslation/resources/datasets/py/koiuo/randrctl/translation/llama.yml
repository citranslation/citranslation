Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Python Test

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.8
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: python setup.py test
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that in GitHub Actions, we use the `on` section to specify the event that triggers the workflow (in this case, a push to the `main` branch). The `jobs` section defines the job that will run, which is named `test`. The `runs-on` section specifies the environment in which the job will run (in this case, an `ubuntu-latest` environment). The `steps` section defines the individual steps that will be executed in the job.
