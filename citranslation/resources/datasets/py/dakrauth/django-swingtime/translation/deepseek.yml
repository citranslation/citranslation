Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Python package

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install tox-gh-actions
    - name: Test with tox
      run: tox
```

This GitHub Action configuration does the following:

1. It sets up a workflow that runs on every push and pull request.
2. It specifies that the job should run on the latest version of Ubuntu.
3. It sets up a matrix of Python versions to test (3.6, 3.7, and 3.8).
4. It checks out the repository.
5. It sets up the specified Python version.
6. It installs the necessary dependencies (`tox-gh-actions`).
7. It runs the tests with `tox`.

Please note that the `tox-gh-actions` package is not available in PyPI, so you might need to replace it with an equivalent package that is available in PyPI.
