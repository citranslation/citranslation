Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python: |
          - 3.8
          - 3.9
          - 3.10
          - 3.11
          - 3.12
          - nightly
          - pypy3.6

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python }}

      - name: Run setconf.py
        run:./setconf.py --test

      - name: Run testcases
        run: cd testcases &&./test.sh
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that in GitHub Actions, we use a `matrix` strategy to run the same job multiple times with different Python versions. We also use the `actions/checkout` and `actions/setup-python` actions to checkout the code and set up the Python environment, respectively. The rest of the steps are similar to the Travis CI configuration.
