Here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Python application

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, 3.10]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install .
    - name: Install scipy
      run: pip install scipy
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: pytest

notifications:
  slack:
    secrets:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    channels:
      - bayeso:FWBoHH9TMqjKUJWkZxCaTNVE
```

Please note that the `dist: noble` in Travis CI is not a recognized option in GitHub Actions. The `actions/setup-python@v2` step is used to set up the Python environment, which is the closest equivalent in GitHub Actions. The `noble` distribution is not available in GitHub Actions.

Also, the `notifications` section in Travis CI is used to send notifications to a Slack channel. In GitHub Actions, you can use the `slack` action to send notifications to a Slack channel. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` is used to authenticate with the Slack API.

The `runs-on` field in the GitHub Actions configuration specifies the type of machine to run the job on. The `ubuntu-latest` value is used to run the job on the latest version of Ubuntu.

The `strategy` field is used to specify the matrix of Python versions to test. The `matrix` field is used to specify the different versions of Python to test.

The `steps` field is used to specify the steps to run in the job. Each step is a separate action that can be used to check out the code, set up the Python environment, install dependencies, run tests, and more.

The `uses` keyword is used to use a GitHub Action. The `actions/checkout@v2` action is used to check out the code, and the `actions/setup-python@v2` action is used to set up the Python environment.

The `name` and `run` fields are used to specify the name of the step and the command to run. The `pip install --upgrade pip` command is used to upgrade pip, and the `pip install .` and `pip install scipy` commands are used to install the dependencies and scipy, respectively.

The `needs` keyword is used to specify that a job depends on another job. In this case, the `test` job depends on the `build` job.

The `secrets` field is used to specify the secrets to use in the Slack notification. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret is used to authenticate with the Slack API.

The `channels` field is used to specify the Slack channels to send the notifications to.
