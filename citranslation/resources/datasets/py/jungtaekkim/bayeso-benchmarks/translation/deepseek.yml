Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Python package

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, 3.10]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install .
    - name: Install scipy
      run: pip install scipy
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: pytest

|End-of-Code|
```

This configuration will trigger the workflow on every push and pull request to the repository. It will run on the latest version of Ubuntu, and for each Python version specified in the matrix, it will install the dependencies, install scipy, and run the tests.
