Here is the GitHub Action configuration equivalent to the provided Travis CI configuration:

```yaml
name: Run Tests and Linter

on:
  push:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master
      - main

jobs:
  lint-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8.18, 3.9.18, 3.10.13, 3.11.8]
        django-version: [3.2, 4.2]

    name: Lint and Test (Python ${{ matrix.python-version }} - Django ${{ matrix.django-version }})

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -q Django==${{ matrix.django-version }}
          pip install -e .[flake8,tests]

      - name: Add current directory to PYTHONPATH
        run: echo "PYTHONPATH=$PWD" >> $GITHUB_ENV

      - name: Lint with flake8
        run: flake8

      - name: Test with pytest
        run: pytest

```

Please note that the GitHub Actions configuration is not exactly the same as the Travis CI configuration. The GitHub Actions configuration is a direct translation of the Travis CI configuration, but some details may have been adjusted to fit the specifics of GitHub Actions. For example, the `sudo: false` directive in Travis CI is not necessary in GitHub Actions because it is the default behavior. Similarly, the `cache` directive in Travis CI is not necessary in GitHub Actions because it is automatically handled by the `actions/setup-python@v5` action.
