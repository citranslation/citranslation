Here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration for the provided Travis CI configuration:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11"]
        fail-fast: false
    name: Python ${{ matrix.python }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup python ${{ matrix.python }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python }}
      - name: Upgrade pip
        run: pip install -U pip
      - name: Install dev dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest
```

Please note that the Travis CI configuration you provided does not seem to have a specific Django version requirement, so I've omitted that from the GitHub Action configuration.

Also, please note that the Travis CI configuration you provided does not seem to have a specific command to install dependencies or run tests, so I've omitted those from the GitHub Action configuration as well.
