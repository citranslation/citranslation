## 2. Task:
Migrate the above Travis CI configuration to Github Action. 

## 3. Guideline

- Syntax:
    - Ensure YAML file follows proper syntax, including required symbols, e.g., colons, hyphens, or quotation marks.
    - Verify that GitHub Actions YAML file follows proper indentation and structural conventions.
    - Ensure all used definitions are correctly defined and properly placed.
    - Ensure the value types match their expected format when such fields exist in the source configuration, e.g., the setup-python action expects a single version value, not a list.

- Platform Discrepancy:
    - Translate Travis CI keys only when a clear, direct GitHub Actions equivalent exists. Skip any Travis CI–specific or unsupported keys.
    - Verify that all expressions are properly converted to GitHub Actions syntax, e.g., 'env: TOX_ENV=flake8' to 'TOX_ENV: flake8'.
    - Retain only x64 and arm64 if architectures are explicitly defined; remove all other architectures.
    - Ensure all version numbers are in string format, e.g., Python '3.10'.
    - Explicitly configure fields that are implicitly defaulted in Travis CI as equivalent GitHub Actions steps, e.g., actions/checkout@v4.
    - Ensure all packages are properly installed and configured when present in the Travis CI configuration, e.g., migrate tox-travis to tox-gh-actions if applicable.

- Environment:
    - Ensure all referenced GitHub Actions currently exist; avoid non-existent actions.
    - Ensure all required tokens are properly configured for the migrated steps, e.g., set GITHUB_TOKEN in the coveralls step if such a step exists.

- Logic:
    - Ensure all trigger events are correctly translated, e.g., avoid using tags as the sole trigger event unless the Travis CI configuration explicitly relies on tag-only builds.
    - Ensure all execution orders are correctly translated, e.g., deploy job should be configured with the `needs` parameter to execute after test job.
    - Ensure conditional statements are correctly translated.
    - Do not introduce extra jobs, steps, operating systems, or matrix dimensions beyond those implied by the Travis CI configuration, except where required to faithfully reproduce Travis CI default behavior.
    - Ensure that all transferable steps have been migrated.
