Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Travis CI to GitHub Actions

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python 3.8
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements-test.txt

    - name: Run tests
      run: python setup.py nosetests

    - name: Coveralls
      run: |
        pip install coveralls
        coveralls

    - name: Notifications
      uses: uralbash/action-irc@v1.0.0
      with:
        server: chat.freenode.net
        port: 6667
        channel: "#sacrud"
        nick: "sacrud"
        password: ${{ secrets.IRC_PASSWORD }}
        message: "Build status: ${{ job.status }}"
        on_success: change
        on_failure: always

    - name: Email notifications
      uses: dawidd6/action-send-mail@v2.11.0
      with:
        server_address: smtp.gmail.com
        server_port: 465
        username: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.EMAIL_PASSWORD }}
        subject: Travis CI build status
        body: Build status: ${{ job.status }}
        to: "sacrud@uralbash.ru"
        from: "Travis CI"
        on_success: change
        on_failure: always

|End-of-Code|
```

Please replace the `IRC_PASSWORD`, `EMAIL_USERNAME`, and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` with your actual IRC password, email username, and email password. Also, you may need to adjust the Python version and dependencies according to your project's needs.
