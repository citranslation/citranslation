Here is the migrated GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements-test.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: python setup.py nosetests
      - name: Send notifications
        uses: env-var/notify@v1
        with:
          email: "sacrud@uralbash.ru"
          irc: "chat.freenode.net#sacrud"
      - name: Upload coverage report
        uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}
          file: coverage.xml
      - name: Deploy
        run: |
          pip install coveralls
          coveralls
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that I've made the following changes:

* Replaced `dist` and `sudo` with `runs-on` and `uses` respectively, as GitHub Actions uses a different syntax.
* Replaced `notifications` with a separate step that uses the `env-var/notify` action to send notifications.
* Replaced `python` with `run` to specify the command to run.
* Replaced `after_success` with a separate step that uploads the coverage report using the `codecov/codecov-action` action.
* Removed the `language` and `notifications` sections, as they are not needed in GitHub Actions.
* Removed the `dist` and `sudo` sections, as they are not needed in GitHub Actions.
* Replaced `pip install` with `pip install -r requirements-test.txt` to install dependencies from the `requirements-test.txt` file.
* Replaced `python setup.py nosetests` with `python setup.py nosetests` to run the tests.
* Replaced `coveralls` with `pip install coveralls` and `coveralls` to install and run coveralls.
