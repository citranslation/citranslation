Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Python package

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]
  release:
    types: [ created ]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python 3.8
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8

    - name: Cache pip
      uses: actions/cache@v2
      with:
        path: ~/.cache/pip
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/poetry.lock.json') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-pip-

    - name: Install Poetry
      run: curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python -

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: poetry install

    - name: Test with pytest
      run: poetry run pytest

    - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
      uses: codecov/codecov-action@v1
      with:
        token: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}

    - name: Publish to PyPI
      if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags')
      run: |
        poetry config pypi-token.pypi ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
        poetry publish --no-interaction --build
      env:
        POETRY_PYPI_TOKEN_PYPI: ${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}
```

Please replace `${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}` and `${{ secrets.PYPI_TOKEN }}` with your actual secrets. You can set these in your GitHub repository settings under "Secrets".

This GitHub Actions configuration does the following:

- It triggers on push and pull request events for the master branch.
- It sets up Python 3.8 environment.
- It caches pip to speed up subsequent builds.
- It installs Poetry and dependencies.
- It runs tests with pytest.
- It uploads coverage to Codecov.
- It publishes to PyPI if the ref starts with 'refs/tags'.

Please note that GitHub Actions does not support email notifications out of the box, so you may need to use other services like Slack or email integration to get notifications.
