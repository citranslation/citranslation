Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Python package

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python 3.8
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install coverage
        pip install coveralls
        pip install mock
        pip install .

    - name: Change directory
      run: cd tests

    - name: Test with coverage
      run: make coverage

    - name: Send coverage to coveralls
      run: coveralls --rc=coveragerc

```

Please note that the `make coverage` command in the script section is assuming that you have a Makefile in your tests directory that contains a rule named "coverage". If you don't have such a rule, you may need to adjust the command accordingly.
