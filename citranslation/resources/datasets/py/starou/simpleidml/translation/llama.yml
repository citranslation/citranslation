Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install -q coverage
          python -m pip install -q coveralls
          python -m pip install -q mock
          python -m pip install.
      - name: Run tests
        run: make coverage
      - name: Generate coverage report
        uses: coveralls-action/coveralls@v2
        with:
          rc-file: coveragerc
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that in GitHub Actions, we use the `runs-on` keyword to specify the environment (in this case, an `ubuntu-latest` environment), and the `steps` keyword to define the sequence of actions to perform. We also use the `uses` keyword to reuse existing actions, such as `actions/checkout@v2` and `coveralls-action/coveralls@v2`.
