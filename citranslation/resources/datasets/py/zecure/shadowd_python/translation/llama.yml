Here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:
```
name: Python Test

on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.8'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: python setup.py test
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that I've used the `actions/checkout` action to check out the code, `actions/setup-python` to set up Python 3.6, and `pip install` to install dependencies. The `run` keyword is used to execute the `setup.py test` command.
