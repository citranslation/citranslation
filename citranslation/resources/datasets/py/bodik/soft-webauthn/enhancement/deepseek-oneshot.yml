Here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Test
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches:    
      - master
      - development

jobs:
  setup:
    runs_on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo content # fetch the contents of the repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python 3.9
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.9
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: make install-deps
      - name: Setup
        run: make setup
      - name: Test with pytest
        run: make test
```

Please note that the `dist: noble` directive in Travis CI is not recognized by GitHub Actions. The `actions/setup-python@v2` step is used to set up Python 3.9, and the `make install-deps` command is assumed to be equivalent to `pip install -r requirements.txt` or similar in the context of a Python project.

Also, the `script` directive in Travis CI is equivalent to the `Test with pytest` step in GitHub Actions.
