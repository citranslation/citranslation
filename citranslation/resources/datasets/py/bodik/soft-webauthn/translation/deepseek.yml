Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Python application

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python 3.9
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.9

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: make install-deps

    - name: Build
      run: make

```

This configuration will trigger the workflow on every push and pull request to the repository. It will use the latest version of Ubuntu to run the job, set up Python 3.9, install the dependencies using `make install-deps`, and then build the project using `make`.
