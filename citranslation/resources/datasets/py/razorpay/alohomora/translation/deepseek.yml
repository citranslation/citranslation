Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Python package

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [2.7, 3.6, pypy, pypy3]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -U setuptools pip
        python setup.py clean --all
        python setup.py install
    - name: Test with pytest
      run: |
        python setup.py test
      continue-on-error: true
```

Please note that the `matrix.allow_failures` feature from Travis CI is not directly supported in GitHub Actions. If you want to allow some jobs to fail, you can use `continue-on-error: true` in the step that you want to allow to fail.
