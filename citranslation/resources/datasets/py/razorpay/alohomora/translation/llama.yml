Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python: ["2.7", "3.6", "pypy", "pypy3"]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -U setuptools pip
      - name: Clean and install
        run: |
          python setup.py clean --all
          python setup.py install
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          python setup.py test
      - name: Allow failures for pypy and pypy3
        if: github.matrix.python == "pypy" || github.matrix.python == "pypy3"
        run: |
          echo "Skipping test for pypy and pypy3"
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that in GitHub Actions, we use a `matrix` strategy to define the Python versions to run, and we use `runs-on` to specify the environment (in this case, `ubuntu-latest`). We also use `uses` to checkout the code and `run` to execute the commands. The `if` statement is used to skip the test for pypy and pypy3 as specified in the original Travis CI configuration.
