Here is the GitHub Action configuration equivalent to the provided Travis CI configuration:

```yaml
name: tests
on:
  push:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        python-version: ['3.9', '3.8', '3.x']

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
          cache: 'pip'
          cache-dependency-path: 'py.requirements/*.txt'
      - name: Install Python package dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
          pip install --upgrade -r py.requirements/testing.txt
          pip install -e .
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest
```

Please note that the Python version matrix in the GitHub Action configuration is set to ['3.9', '3.8', '3.x'] which is not present in the Travis CI configuration. You may need to adjust this to match your Travis CI configuration.
