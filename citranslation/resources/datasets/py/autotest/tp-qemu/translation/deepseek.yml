Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Travis CI to GitHub Actions

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install sphinx
        pip install -r requirements-travis.txt

    - name: Run inspekt checkall
      run: inspekt checkall --disable-style E501,E265,W601,E402,E722,E741 --enable-lint W0611,W1201 --no-license-check

```

Please note that GitHub Actions does not support Python 3.9 and 3.10 out of the box, you may need to add additional steps to set up these versions. Also, the `sudo: false` directive in Travis CI is not necessary in GitHub Actions as it is the default behavior.
