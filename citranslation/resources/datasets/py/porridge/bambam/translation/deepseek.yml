Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Python application

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python 3.8
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8

    - name: Set up Python 3.9
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.9

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

    - name: Lint with flake8
      run: flake8 .

    - name: Check with autopep8
      run: |
        autopep8 -d *.py | awk 'BEGIN{had_data=0}{print;had_data=1}END{exit had_data}'
```

This GitHub Action configuration does the following:

1. It sets up a workflow that runs on every push and pull request.
2. It uses the latest version of Ubuntu for the build environment.
3. It checks out the repository.
4. It sets up Python 2.7 and 3.5.
5. It installs the dependencies listed in `requirements-dev.txt`.
6. It runs `flake8` to lint the Python code.
7. It runs `autopep8` to check the Python code and `awk` to print the diff if there are any changes.

Please replace `.` with your specific directory if you want to check a specific directory.
