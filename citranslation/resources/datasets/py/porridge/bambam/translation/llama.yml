Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          python -c 'import bambam'
      - name: Lint code
        run: |
          flake8 *.py
      - name: Format code
        run: |
          autopep8 -d *.py | awk 'BEGIN{had_data=0}{print;had_data=1}END{exit had_data}'
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that in GitHub Actions, we use the `runs-on` keyword to specify the environment (in this case, an `ubuntu-latest` environment), and the `steps` keyword to define the sequence of actions. Each step is a separate command that is executed in sequence.
