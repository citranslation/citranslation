Here is the GitHub Action configuration equivalent to the provided Travis CI configuration:

```yaml
name: Python Test

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, 3.10]

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        pip install .
        pip install coveralls

    - name: Test with coverage
      run: |
        coverage run --source=nvd3 setup.py test

    - name: Upload to coveralls
      run: |
        coveralls
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
|End-of-Code|
```

Please note that the `setup.py test` command in the Travis CI configuration is not a standard Python command for running tests. You may need to adjust the command based on your project's specific test setup.
