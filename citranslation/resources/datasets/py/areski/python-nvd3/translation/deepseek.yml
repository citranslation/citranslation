Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Travis CI to GitHub Actions

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python 3.8
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.8

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        python setup.py install
        pip install coveralls

    - name: Run tests
      run: |
        coverage run --source=nvd3 setup.py test

    - name: Coveralls
      run: coveralls

    - name: Notifications
      if: failure()
      uses: dorny/test-reporter@v1
      with:
        artifact: coverage.json
        name: Coverage report
        path: ./coverage.json
        reporter: python-junit

|End-of-Code|
```

This GitHub Actions configuration does the same thing as your Travis CI configuration. It sets up a workflow that runs on every push and pull request. The workflow installs Python 3.8, installs the dependencies, runs the tests, and reports the coverage to Coveralls. If the tests fail, it also reports the failure to the dorny/test-reporter.
