Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Python package

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install tox-gh-actions
    - name: Test with tox
      run: tox
```

Please note that the `dist: noble` directive in your Travis CI configuration is not recognized by GitHub Actions. The `dist:` directive in GitHub Actions is used to specify the type of Linux distribution to use, but there are no "noble" options available. The `language: python` directive in your Travis CI configuration is equivalent to the `name: Python package` line in the GitHub Actions configuration.
