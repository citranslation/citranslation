Here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, 3.10]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        nvm install
        nvm use
        pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
        pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    - name: Migrate database
      run: python manage.py migrate
    - name: Check Django project
      run: python manage.py check
    - name: Lint with flake8
      run: flake8 .
    - name: Lint JavaScript
      run: ./lint_js.sh
    - name: Build JavaScript
      run: ./build_js.sh
    - name: Test JavaScript
      run: ./test_js.sh
    - name: Build frontend client
      run: |
        # Need to build the frontend client before running some of the Django tests
        # that use the Django test Client
        ./runtests.py
```

Please note that the GitHub Actions configuration is different from Travis CI. Travis CI is a continuous integration service that is used to build and test your code every time you commit changes to your repository. GitHub Actions, on the other hand, is a new way to automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository.
