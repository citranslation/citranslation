Here is the GitHub Action configuration equivalent to the provided Travis CI configuration:

```yaml
name: Tests

on:
  push:
  pull_request:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 1 * *' # monthly

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy: 
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest]
        python-version: ['3.8', '3.9', '3.10']
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install pytest pytest-cov
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Test with pytest
        run: |
          pytest
|End-of-Code|
```

Please note that the GitHub Actions configuration is not exactly the same as the Travis CI configuration. The Travis CI configuration includes the use of the `sudo: false` directive, which is not necessary in GitHub Actions as it uses a virtual environment by default. The Travis CI configuration also includes the use of the `dist: jammy` directive, which is not applicable in GitHub Actions as it is used to specify the Ubuntu distribution.
