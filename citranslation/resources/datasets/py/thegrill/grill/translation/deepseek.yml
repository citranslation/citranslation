Sure, here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Python package

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python 3.9
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.9

    - name: Install graphviz and dependencies
      run: |
        sudo apt-get install graphviz graphviz-dev
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools

    - name: Install pytest, codecov, and pytest-cov
      run: pip install pytest codecov pytest-cov

    - name: Install package and test dependencies
      run: pip install ".[full,test]" .

    - name: Run tests
      env:
        QT_QPA_PLATFORM: "offscreen"
      run: pytest --rootdir $GITHUB_WORKSPACE --cov=./

    - name: Upload coverage to Codecov
      run: codecov

```

Please note that the `TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR` environment variable in Travis CI is equivalent to `GITHUB_WORKSPACE` in GitHub Actions.

Also, the `actions/checkout@v2` step is used to checkout your repository's code into the GitHub Actions runner.

The `actions/setup-python@v2` step is used to set up a specific Python version.

The `run` keyword is used to run shell commands.

The `env` keyword is used to set environment variables.

The `codecov` command is used to upload coverage data to Codecov.
