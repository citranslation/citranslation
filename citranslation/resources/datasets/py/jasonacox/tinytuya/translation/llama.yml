Here is the migrated GitHub Actions configuration:
```
name: Python CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python: ["3.8", "3.9", "3.10", "3.11"]
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          pip install pycryptodome
          pip install requests
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          python test.py
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that in GitHub Actions, we use a `matrix` strategy to run the job for multiple Python versions, whereas in Travis CI, we used a list of Python versions. We also use the `actions/checkout` action to checkout the code, and the `run` keyword to execute the commands.
