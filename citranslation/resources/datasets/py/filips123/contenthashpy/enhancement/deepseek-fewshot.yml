Here is the equivalent GitHub Action configuration:

```yaml
name: Travis CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        python-version: ['3.5', '3.6', '3.7', '3.8', '3.9', '3.10', '3.11', '3.12', '3.13', 'nightly', 'pypy3.8', 'pypy3.9', 'pypy3.10', 'pypy3.11']

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install pytest pytest-cov coveralls coverage
        if [[ ${{ matrix.python-version }} == 'pypy'* ]]; then export TRAVIS_WAIT=45; else export TRAVIS_WAIT=20; fi

    - name: Run tests with coverage
      run: |
        coverage run --source=neat -m pytest tests

    - name: Upload coverage to Coveralls
      if: matrix.python-version == '3.11'
      env:
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      run: |
        coveralls --service=github
```

Please note that the GitHub Actions configuration is not as comprehensive as the Travis CI configuration. It only covers the basic functionality of running tests with coverage and uploading the coverage report to Coveralls. For more complex configurations, you may need to adjust the GitHub Actions configuration accordingly.
