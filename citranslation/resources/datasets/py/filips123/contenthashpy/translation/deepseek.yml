Here is the equivalent GitHub Actions configuration:

```yaml
name: Travis CI to GitHub Actions

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 'nightly']

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install pylint pytest pytest-cov

    - name: Lint with pylint
      run: |
        pylint content_hash/*
        pylint example.py

    - name: Test with pytest
      run: pytest --cov=content_hash

    - name: Deploy to PyPI
      if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags')
      uses: pypa-dev/setuptools/actions/publish@v1
      with:
        user: ${{ secrets.PYPI_USER }}
        password: ${{ secrets.PYPI_PASSWORD }}
        distributions: "sdist bdist_wheel"
|End-of-Code|
```

Please note that GitHub Actions does not have a direct equivalent to Travis CI's `travis_retry` command. The `run` command in the GitHub Actions configuration will retry the command if it fails.

Also, GitHub Actions does not have a direct equivalent to Travis CI's `fast_finish` or `allow_failures` features. The `strategy.matrix` in the GitHub Actions configuration allows you to specify different combinations of Python versions to run on.

Finally, GitHub Actions does not have a direct equivalent to Travis CI's `cache` feature. The `actions/cache@v2` can be used to cache dependencies, but it's not as straightforward as Travis CI's `cache: pip`.
