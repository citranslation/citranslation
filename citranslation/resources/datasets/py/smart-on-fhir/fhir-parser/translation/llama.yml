Here is the migrated GitHub Action configuration:
```
name: CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Generate settings
        run: |
          echo "from Default.settings import *" > settings.py
      - name: Run generate script
        run:./generate.py
|End-of-Code|
```
Note that I've assumed that the `generate.py` script is in the root of the repository, and that the `requirements.txt` file is also in the root of the repository. If this is not the case, you'll need to adjust the `run` commands accordingly.
