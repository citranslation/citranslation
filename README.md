# CItranslation

This repository contains the replication package for the **CI Translation** project.

## Datasets

The dataset is located under the `citranslation/resource/datasets` directory and includes **301 software projects**.

## Project Collection Process

The original CSV files were generated using the **SEART GitHub Search Engine**. We used the script `scripts/run_SearchActions.py` to:

* Search and filter candidate GitHub projects
* Generate intermediate CSV files saved in the `filter` folder

After **manual screening and cleaning**, the final selected projects were consolidated and saved into `datasets.csv`.
